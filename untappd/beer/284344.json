But, really, in this day and age it seems you can’t go and release a Pale Ale without having it loaded with hops – you’ll be laughed out of the brewery. No chance here though; hops from the two countries give a heap of passionfruit, mango and citrus aromas. But it’s not all in the head. While the beer has been designed to have a clean and dry finish, over the top of the malt you get the hop characters coming through again. That helps add bitterness which contributes to a refreshing beer that doesn’t lack for flavour. The best way to sum up this beer? It’s just feels really good to drink.",

No chance here though; hops from the two countries give a heap of passionfruit, mango and citrus aromas. But it’s not all in the head. While the beer has been designed to have a clean and dry finish, over the top of the malt you get the hop characters coming through again. That helps add bitterness which contributes to a refreshing beer that doesn’t lack for flavour. The best way to sum up this beer? It’s just feels really good to drink.",

But, really, in this day and age it seems you can’t go and release a Pale Ale without having it loaded with hops – you’ll be laughed out of the brewery. No chance here though; hops from the two countries give a heap of passionfruit, mango and citrus aromas. But it’s not all in the head. While the beer has been designed to have a clean and dry finish, over the top of the malt you get the hop characters coming through again. That helps add bitterness which contributes to a refreshing beer that doesn’t lack for flavour. The best way to sum up this beer? It’s just feels really good to drink.",

No chance here though; hops from the two countries give a heap of passionfruit, mango and citrus aromas. But it’s not all in the head. While the beer has been designed to have a clean and dry finish, over the top of the malt you get the hop characters coming through again. That helps add bitterness which contributes to a refreshing beer that doesn’t lack for flavour. The best way to sum up this beer? It’s just feels really good to drink.",

No chance here though; hops from the two countries give a heap of passionfruit, mango and citrus aromas. But it’s not all in the head. While the beer has been designed to have a clean and dry finish, over the top of the malt you get the hop characters coming through again. That helps add bitterness which contributes to a refreshing beer that doesn’t lack for flavour. The best way to sum up this beer? It’s just feels really good to drink.",

But, really, in this day and age it seems you can’t go and release a Pale Ale without having it loaded with hops – you’ll be laughed out of the brewery. No chance here though; hops from the two countries give a heap of passionfruit, mango and citrus aromas. But it’s not all in the head. While the beer has been designed to have a clean and dry finish, over the top of the malt you get the hop characters coming through again. That helps add bitterness which contributes to a refreshing beer that doesn’t lack for flavour. The best way to sum up this beer? It’s just feels really good to drink.",
