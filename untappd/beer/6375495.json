sharply angled and engineered for maximum juice. This Hazy Double IPA was fermented with an expressive yeast strain and dry hopped heavily with Nelson Sauvin, Citra Cryo, HBC 586 & Galaxy. The resulting flavors and aromas of mango, pink guava, juicy nectarine and ripe pineapple inspire and surprise at every turn. A nuanced amount of highly refined bitterness and a sumptuously mouthfeel make for a deceptively potent quaff. Inspired by the alluring combination of form and function possessed by its namesake, a classic that looked fast even when it was sitting still.\r\n","beer_name":"Countach","type_id":227,"beer_abv":8.1}},"brewed_by":{"count":0,"items":[]}}}}
