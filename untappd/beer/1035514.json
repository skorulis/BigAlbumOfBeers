The Albo is our tribute to that beer and to the men and women who made and drank the beer back in the day.\n\nOur version of this historic beer uses corn and pilsner malt as the base and it is very lightly hopped with Galaxy. The nose is slightly cornny and on the pallet it is fresh and clean with a great flavor length leaving the drinker wanting more.\n\nNamed after our Local Federal Member Anthony Albanese. The Albo is best enjoyed with mates old and new.",

The nose is slightly cornny and on the pallet it is fresh and clean with a great flavor length leaving the drinker wanting more.\n\nNamed after our Local Federal Member Anthony Albanese.
