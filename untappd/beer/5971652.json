So a few months back, over a few beers we got talking and came up with the idea of brewing a 2 part IPA series. The beers would use the same Hops, Similar yeast strains\/process' but us at Banks brewing a NW Style West Coast IPA showcasing a more malt driven backbone & chewy, resiny character. @hopnationbeer would do the same but in a Cali Style West Coast IPA. showcasing bright punchy Citrus character. With both beers showcasing some of our favourite & epic hops in Nelson Sauvin, Simcoe & Citra. ⁠","beer_style":"IPA - American","has_had":false,"beer_active":1},"brewery":{"brewery_id":274053,"brewery_name":"Banks Brewing","brewery_slug":"banks-brewing","brewery_page_url":"\/BanksBrewery","brewery_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/brewery_logos\/brewery-274053_0c6f0.jpeg","country_name":"Australia","contact":{"twitter":"","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/banksbrewingco","url":"https:\/\/www.banksbrewing.com.au"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Seaford","brewery_state":"Victoria","lat":-38.1161,"lng":145.138},"brewery_active":1},"venue":{"venue_id":9917985,"venue_name":"Untappd at Home","venue_slug":"at-home","primary_category_en":null,"primary_category":null,"parent_category_id":"4e67e38e036454776db1fb3a","categories":{"count":1,"items":[{"category_key":"home_private","category_name_en":"Home (private)","category_name":"Home (private)","category_id":"4bf58dd8d48988d103941735","is_primary":true}]},"location":{"venue_address":"","venue_city":"","venue_state":"NC","venue_country":"United States","lat":34.2346611,"lng":-77.9482117},"contact":{"twitter":"","venue_url":""},"foursquare":{"foursquare_id":"5e7b4d99c91df60008e8b168","foursquare_url":"https:\/\/4sq.com\/3bDWYuq"},"venue_icon":{"sm":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/venuelogos\/venue_9917985_b3a5d245_bg_64.png","md":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/venuelogos\/venue_9917985_b3a5d245_bg_88.png","lg":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/venuelogos\/venue_9917985_b3a5d245_bg_176.png?v=1"},"is_verified":true,"spotlights":[],"has_beer":false,"has_food":false,"has_wine":false,"has_spirits":false},"comments":{"total_count":0,"count":0,"items":[]},"toasts":{"total_count":1,"count":0,"auth_toast":null,"items":[]},"media":{"count":1,"items":[{"photo_id":576935072,"photo":{"photo_img_sm":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=200&height=200&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2024_12_27\/70529f076f01ff82263c84f9b2b7b9e1_c_1445128133_raw.jpg","photo_img_md":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=640&height=640&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2024_12_27\/70529f076f01ff82263c84f9b2b7b9e1_c_1445128133_raw.jpg","photo_img_lg":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=1280&height=1280&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2024_12_27\/70529f076f01ff82263c84f9b2b7b9e1_c_1445128133_raw.jpg","photo_img_og":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/photos\/2024_12_27\/70529f076f01ff82263c84f9b2b7b9e1_c_1445128133_raw.jpg"}}]},"source":{"app_name":"Untappd for iPhone - (V2)","app_website":"http:\/\/untpd.it\/iphoneapp"},"badges":{"retro_status":false,"count":2,"items":[{"badge_id":575239,"user_badge_id":1265901870,"badge_name":"Ale Trail: IPA - American","badge_description":"You've just tried one of three available styles from Style Hunt - Ale Trail!\n","created_at":"Fri, 27 Dec 2024 07:36:43 +0000","badge_image":{"sm":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/badges\/YIB24-Badge_AmericanIPA_1000x1000.png","md":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/badges\/YIB24-Badge_AmericanIPA_1000x1000.png","lg":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/badges\/YIB24-Badge_AmericanIPA_1000x1000.png"}},{"badge_id":90671,"user_badge_id":1265901872,"badge_name":"Verified Adventure (Level 86)","badge_description":"While spontaneity can be fun, sometimes you want to make sure your adventure will rock.
