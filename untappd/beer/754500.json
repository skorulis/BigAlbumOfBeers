If you can imagine chucking your favourite record on but accidentally choosing the wrong speed… you know you have all the right ingredients for a fantastic listening experience… but there’s just something not quite right… well that’s what we encountered in the development of  this beer.  Overcoming breakdowns, ingredients / hop (un)availability, brain fades, brain waves, and through blending, fine tuning, tinkering and working with the ingredients, we made our way to a beer we are very proud of.\n\nWe trialled many different ingredients and allowed the beer to tell us what it wanted to be (to the total frustration of our friendly suppliers). In the end we pitted two classic Belgian yeast strains against each other, challenged them with an array of gorgeous hops (some now relegated to the bench) and watched in awe and horror while some of our favourite specialty malts were cast aside in favour of some previously little known but now champion malts of this brew…\n\nWhat you taste now is a beer with a beautiful balance of delicate fruit esters and subtle spicy notes - neither one dominates the palate - and is supported by a well-integrated malt backbone and everyone’s favourite; truckloads of aromatic hop flowers.

If you can imagine chucking your favourite record on but accidentally choosing the wrong speed… you know you have all the right ingredients for a fantastic listening experience… but there’s just something not quite right… well that’s what we encountered in the development of  this beer.  Overcoming breakdowns, ingredients / hop (un)availability, brain fades, brain waves, and through blending, fine tuning, tinkering and working with the ingredients, we made our way to a beer we are very proud of.\n\nWe trialled many different ingredients and allowed the beer to tell us what it wanted to be (to the total frustration of our friendly suppliers). In the end we pitted two classic Belgian yeast strains against each other, challenged them with an array of gorgeous hops (some now relegated to the bench) and watched in awe and horror while some of our favourite specialty malts were cast aside in favour of some previously little known but now champion malts of this brew…\n\nWhat you taste now is a beer with a beautiful balance of delicate fruit esters and subtle spicy notes - neither one dominates the palate - and is supported by a well-integrated malt backbone and everyone’s favourite; truckloads of aromatic hop flowers.

Overcoming breakdowns, ingredients / hop (un)availability, brain fades, brain waves, and through blending, fine tuning, tinkering and working with the ingredients, we made our way to a beer we are very proud of.\n\nWe trialled many different ingredients and allowed the beer to tell us what it wanted to be (to the total frustration of our friendly suppliers). In the end we pitted two classic Belgian yeast strains against each other, challenged them with an array of gorgeous hops (some now relegated to the bench) and watched in awe and horror while some of our favourite specialty malts were cast aside in favour of some previously little known but now champion malts of this brew…\n\nWhat you taste now is a beer with a beautiful balance of delicate fruit esters and subtle spicy notes - neither one dominates the palate - and is supported by a well-integrated malt backbone and everyone’s favourite; truckloads of aromatic hop flowers.

If you can imagine chucking your favourite record on but accidentally choosing the wrong speed… you know you have all the right ingredients for a fantastic listening experience… but there’s just something not quite right… well that’s what we encountered in the development of  this beer.  Overcoming breakdowns, ingredients / hop (un)availability, brain fades, brain waves, and through blending, fine tuning, tinkering and working with the ingredients, we made our way to a beer we are very proud of.\n\nWe trialled many different ingredients and allowed the beer to tell us what it wanted to be (to the total frustration of our friendly suppliers). In the end we pitted two classic Belgian yeast strains against each other, challenged them with an array of gorgeous hops (some now relegated to the bench) and watched in awe and horror while some of our favourite specialty malts were cast aside in favour of some previously little known but now champion malts of this brew…\n\nWhat you taste now is a beer with a beautiful balance of delicate fruit esters and subtle spicy notes - neither one dominates the palate - and is supported by a well-integrated malt backbone and everyone’s favourite; truckloads of aromatic hop flowers.

If you can imagine chucking your favourite record on but accidentally choosing the wrong speed… you know you have all the right ingredients for a fantastic listening experience… but there’s just something not quite right… well that’s what we encountered in the development of  this beer.  Overcoming breakdowns, ingredients / hop (un)availability, brain fades, brain waves, and through blending, fine tuning, tinkering and working with the ingredients, we made our way to a beer we are very proud of.\n\nWe trialled many different ingredients and allowed the beer to tell us what it wanted to be (to the total frustration of our friendly suppliers). In the end we pitted two classic Belgian yeast strains against each other, challenged them with an array of gorgeous hops (some now relegated to the bench) and watched in awe and horror while some of our favourite specialty malts were cast aside in favour of some previously little known but now champion malts of this brew…\n\nWhat you taste now is a beer with a beautiful balance of delicate fruit esters and subtle spicy notes - neither one dominates the palate - and is supported by a well-integrated malt backbone and everyone’s favourite; truckloads of aromatic hop flowers.

If you can imagine chucking your favourite record on but accidentally choosing the wrong speed… you know you have all the right ingredients for a fantastic listening experience… but there’s just something not quite right… well that’s what we encountered in the development of  this beer.  Overcoming breakdowns, ingredients / hop (un)availability, brain fades, brain waves, and through blending, fine tuning, tinkering and working with the ingredients, we made our way to a beer we are very proud of.\n\nWe trialled many different ingredients and allowed the beer to tell us what it wanted to be (to the total frustration of our friendly suppliers). In the end we pitted two classic Belgian yeast strains against each other, challenged them with an array of gorgeous hops (some now relegated to the bench) and watched in awe and horror while some of our favourite specialty malts were cast aside in favour of some previously little known but now champion malts of this brew…\n\nWhat you taste now is a beer with a beautiful balance of delicate fruit esters and subtle spicy notes - neither one dominates the palate - and is supported by a well-integrated malt backbone and everyone’s favourite; truckloads of aromatic hop flowers.

If you can imagine chucking your favourite record on but accidentally choosing the wrong speed… you know you have all the right ingredients for a fantastic listening experience… but there’s just something not quite right… well that’s what we encountered in the development of  this beer.  Overcoming breakdowns, ingredients / hop (un)availability, brain fades, brain waves, and through blending, fine tuning, tinkering and working with the ingredients, we made our way to a beer we are very proud of.\n\nWe trialled many different ingredients and allowed the beer to tell us what it wanted to be (to the total frustration of our friendly suppliers). In the end we pitted two classic Belgian yeast strains against each other, challenged them with an array of gorgeous hops (some now relegated to the bench) and watched in awe and horror while some of our favourite specialty malts were cast aside in favour of some previously little known but now champion malts of this brew…\n\nWhat you taste now is a beer with a beautiful balance of delicate fruit esters and subtle spicy notes - neither one dominates the palate - and is supported by a well-integrated malt backbone and everyone’s favourite; truckloads of aromatic hop flowers.
