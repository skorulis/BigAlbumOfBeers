In the off season, they would often drink beer and produce intricate engravings on the teeth of harvested whales, better know as “Scrimshaws”. While the whaling station is no longer operational, there is 1 thing that remains prominent in Moreton Bay, a green nautical marker from which we take our name, Green Beacon.\r\n\r\nBrewed with all Australian Pale Barley and Wheat for a light malt character, Scrimshaw is all about \r\nshowcasing the best in Australian grown hops. Bursting with hop aromas of tropical fruit and subtle herbaceous notes of mint and fresh cut grass. The aroma is backed up with flavours of fresh citrus, pineapple and passionfruit. This combination of Australian hops offers a perceived bitterness and resinous mouth coating finish, without being astringent. ",

Bursting with hop aromas of tropical fruit and subtle herbaceous notes of mint and fresh cut grass. The aroma is backed up with flavours of fresh citrus, pineapple and passionfruit.

In the off season, they would often drink beer and produce intricate engravings on the teeth of harvested whales, better know as “Scrimshaws”. While the whaling station is no longer operational, there is 1 thing that remains prominent in Moreton Bay, a green nautical marker from which we take our name, Green Beacon.\r\n\r\nBrewed with all Australian Pale Barley and Wheat for a light malt character, Scrimshaw is all about \r\nshowcasing the best in Australian grown hops. Bursting with hop aromas of tropical fruit and subtle herbaceous notes of mint and fresh cut grass. The aroma is backed up with flavours of fresh citrus, pineapple and passionfruit. This combination of Australian hops offers a perceived bitterness and resinous mouth coating finish, without being astringent. ",
