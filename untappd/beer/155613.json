Kung Foo is fermented with a traditional European lager yeast at cold temperatures, which further helps in producing a clean flavour profile .\n\nFoo is then finished with a combination of American and European aroma hops which give the beer a depth which is not incorporated into typical domestic light/dry beers.",
