The Stowaway is certainly feisty enough to last a long voyage thanks to its rich and robust taste, earthy, resinous and malty aroma and lingering bitter finish.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the Stowaway’s most intriguing quality is its versatility. Drawing on over 200 years of IPA history, the Stowaway is the perfect partner for rich, gamey, traditionally English meat dishes like venison or duck, as well as highly spiced (and even downright hot) Indian dishes, from curry puffs to a brain-meltingly hot vindaloo. Or, if you fancy something that goes well with a few nibbles, the Stowaway is just as happy sailing along with some milder blue cheeses like Gorgonzola or Cambozola.\r\n\r\nMalts: Pale, Munich and Crystal.\r\n\r\nHops: Dr Rudi, EKG, Fuggles and Motueka.","beer_style":"IPA - English","has_had":false,"beer_active":1},"brewery":{"brewery_id":820,"brewery_name":"Malt Shovel Brewery","brewery_slug":"malt-shovel-brewery","brewery_page_url":"\/JamesSquireMaltShovelBrewery","brewery_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/brewery_logos\/brewery-MaltShovelBrewery_820.jpeg","country_name":"Australia","contact":{"twitter":"","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/jamessquire","url":"https:\/\/www.jamessquire.com.au\/"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Camperdown","brewery_state":"New South Wales","lat":-33.8867,"lng":151.175},"brewery_active":1},"venue":{"venue_id":9917985,"venue_name":"Untappd at Home","venue_slug":"at-home","primary_category_key":null,"primary_category":null,"parent_category_id":"4e67e38e036454776db1fb3a","categories":{"count":1,"items":[{"category_key":"home_private","category_name":"Home (private)","category_id":"4bf58dd8d48988d103941735","is_primary":true}]},"location":{"venue_address":"","venue_city":"","venue_state":"NC","venue_country":"United States","lat":34.2346611,"lng":-77.9482117},"contact":{"twitter":"","venue_url":""},"foursquare":{"foursquare_id":"5e7b4d99c91df60008e8b168","foursquare_url":"https:\/\/4sq.com\/3bDWYuq"},"venue_icon":{"sm":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/venuelogos\/venue_9917985_b3a5d245_bg_64.png","md":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/venuelogos\/venue_9917985_b3a5d245_bg_88.png","lg":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/venuelogos\/venue_9917985_b3a5d245_bg_176.png?v=1"},"is_verified":true,"spotlights":[],"has_beer":false,"has_food":false,"has_wine":false,"has_spirits":false},"comments":{"total_count":0,"count":0,"items":[]},"toasts":{"total_count":1,"count":0,"auth_toast":null,"items":[]},"media":{"count":0,"items":[]},"source":{"app_name":"Untappd for iPhone - (V2)","app_website":"http:\/\/untpd.it\/iphoneapp"},"badges":{"retro_status":false,"count":2,"items":[{"badge_id":418002,"user_badge_id":995276480,"badge_name":"Untappd at Home (Level 8)","badge_description":"Thanks for staying at home, and checking in with Untappd!
