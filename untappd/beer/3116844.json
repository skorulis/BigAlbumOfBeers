In fact, it’s so unavoidably drinkable, our Port Adelaide bar team have developed RSI from tilting pints towards its tap.\r\n\r\nSo how did we do it?\r\n\r\nBy introducing lactobacillus (good bacteria) into the kettle and leaving it to work over night, the brewed wort acquires a delicate and pleasant acidity. When paired with a generous dose of passion fruit pulp and Acai berry post fermentation, we invite more pucker to the party and a gorgeous rose blush colour to boot.\r\n\r\nWith a simple malt bill of 50% Pale and 50% Wheat, we allow the souring process and fruit additions to take centre stage. The small amount of Australian Enigma hops we use are added only for a lick of bitterness - no generous dry hop additions here.\r\n\r\nThe nose is summer, passion pulp driven and clean, picked lemon, raspberry sherbet, each bubble bursting to release a suggestion of the tartness to come.\r\n\r\nPalate strikes fresh, lemon rind, stone fruits, tight acidity, a whisper of wheat malt leads to a clean, dry finish.

This sour is not here to complicate things. In fact, it’s so unavoidably drinkable, our Port Adelaide bar team have developed RSI from tilting pints towards its tap.\r\n\r\nSo how did we do it?\r\n\r\nBy introducing lactobacillus (good bacteria) into the kettle and leaving it to work over night, the brewed wort acquires a delicate and pleasant acidity. When paired with a generous dose of passion fruit pulp and Acai berry post fermentation, we invite more pucker to the party and a gorgeous rose blush colour to boot.\r\n\r\nWith a simple malt bill of 50% Pale and 50% Wheat, we allow the souring process and fruit additions to take centre stage. The small amount of Australian Enigma hops we use are added only for a lick of bitterness - no generous dry hop additions here.\r\n\r\nThe nose is summer, passion pulp driven and clean, picked lemon, raspberry sherbet, each bubble bursting to release a suggestion of the tartness to come.\r\n\r\nPalate strikes fresh, lemon rind, stone fruits, tight acidity, a whisper of wheat malt leads to a clean, dry finish. Perfection.\r\n\r\nIf you want something vibrant, something that will awaken your senses and perk up your day, then look no further. PL have you covered, once again.",

This sour is not here to complicate things. In fact, it’s so unavoidably drinkable, our Port Adelaide bar team have developed RSI from tilting pints towards its tap.\r\n\r\nSo how did we do it?\r\n\r\nBy introducing lactobacillus (good bacteria) into the kettle and leaving it to work over night, the brewed wort acquires a delicate and pleasant acidity. When paired with a generous dose of passion fruit pulp and Acai berry post fermentation, we invite more pucker to the party and a gorgeous rose blush colour to boot.\r\n\r\nWith a simple malt bill of 50% Pale and 50% Wheat, we allow the souring process and fruit additions to take centre stage. The small amount of Australian Enigma hops we use are added only for a lick of bitterness - no generous dry hop additions here.\r\n\r\nThe nose is summer, passion pulp driven and clean, picked lemon, raspberry sherbet, each bubble bursting to release a suggestion of the tartness to come.\r\n\r\nPalate strikes fresh, lemon rind, stone fruits, tight acidity, a whisper of wheat malt leads to a clean, dry finish. Perfection.\r\n\r\nIf you want something vibrant, something that will awaken your senses and perk up your day, then look no further. PL have you covered, once again.",

This sour is not here to complicate things. In fact, it’s so unavoidably drinkable, our Port Adelaide bar team have developed RSI from tilting pints towards its tap.\r\n\r\nSo how did we do it?\r\n\r\nBy introducing lactobacillus (good bacteria) into the kettle and leaving it to work over night, the brewed wort acquires a delicate and pleasant acidity. When paired with a generous dose of passion fruit pulp and Acai berry post fermentation, we invite more pucker to the party and a gorgeous rose blush colour to boot.\r\n\r\nWith a simple malt bill of 50% Pale and 50% Wheat, we allow the souring process and fruit additions to take centre stage. The small amount of Australian Enigma hops we use are added only for a lick of bitterness - no generous dry hop additions here.\r\n\r\nThe nose is summer, passion pulp driven and clean, picked lemon, raspberry sherbet, each bubble bursting to release a suggestion of the tartness to come.\r\n\r\nPalate strikes fresh, lemon rind, stone fruits, tight acidity, a whisper of wheat malt leads to a clean, dry finish. Perfection.\r\n\r\nIf you want something vibrant, something that will awaken your senses and perk up your day, then look no further. PL have you covered, once again.",
