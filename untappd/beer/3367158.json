Along with her arch rival Tilly Devine, they were known as two of the toughest gangsters in Sydney. You may have seen their rivalry play out on TV during the Underbelly series on Sydney gangsters. \r\n\r\nTheir battle to become the ‘Queen’ of the Sydney underworld fuelled the razor gang wars of Darlinghurst which lasted from 1927 to 1930. To separate these two, the Courts sent Kate back to Dubbo for two years. At this time she opened ‘Flash Kate’s Casino and Brothel’, now the site of the Milestone Hotel Dubbo. \r\n\r\nWhen sentenced in court Kate is also supposedly to have said “I’d rather be dead than in Dubbo!”. \r\n\r\nShe may have been a nasty bit of work, but there is nothing nasty about this IPA.",

You may have seen their rivalry play out on TV during the Underbelly series on Sydney gangsters. \r\n\r\nTheir battle to become the ‘Queen’ of the Sydney underworld fuelled the razor gang wars of Darlinghurst which lasted from 1927 to 1930. To separate these two, the Courts sent Kate back to Dubbo for two years. At this time she opened ‘Flash Kate’s Casino and Brothel’, now the site of the Milestone Hotel Dubbo. \r\n\r\nWhen sentenced in court Kate is also supposedly to have said “I’d rather be dead than in Dubbo!”. \r\n\r\nShe may have been a nasty bit of work, but there is nothing nasty about this IPA.",
