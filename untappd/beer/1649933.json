Sometimes this resulted in a good lashing and other times in a handsome reward, but always in a good story to tell with a great-tasting beer.\n\nHop Thief American-style Pale Ale began as a Varietal Series – an occasional brew that started out as a chance for the James Squire brewers to experiment. It proved so popular that we’re delighted to now make it a welcome addition to the core James Squire craft beer range. And unlike any other craft beer, this happily hop-heavy brew has the ability to keep reinventing itself (much like James Squire himself) thanks to its changing, evolving hop bill. \n\nIt’s particularly exciting because it means this beer always promises an element of surprise. Having a craft beer that keeps changing its core ingredient on a regular basis to take advantage of the wonderful range of hop varieties from around the world makes an already special beer even more special. And you can bet James Squire would have approved of that!\n\nThe two hops that breathe life to the new brew are the quintessential American pale ale hop Cascade, which the gang at Malt Shovel Brewery have never used before, and Crystal hops, which bring the spice with floral aromas. Both are sourced from the base of the 9 million year old Yakima River, where hop producing began way back in 1872.\n\nMalts: Pale, Munich and Malted Wheat.\n\nHops: Crystal and Cascade.",

It proved so popular that we’re delighted to now make it a welcome addition to the core James Squire craft beer range. And unlike any other craft beer, this happily hop-heavy brew has the ability to keep reinventing itself (much like James Squire himself) thanks to its changing, evolving hop bill. \n\nIt’s particularly exciting because it means this beer always promises an element of surprise. Having a craft beer that keeps changing its core ingredient on a regular basis to take advantage of the wonderful range of hop varieties from around the world makes an already special beer even more special. And you can bet James Squire would have approved of that!\n\nThe two hops that breathe life to the new brew are the quintessential American pale ale hop Cascade, which the gang at Malt Shovel Brewery have never used before, and Crystal hops, which bring the spice with floral aromas. Both are sourced from the base of the 9 million year old Yakima River, where hop producing began way back in 1872.\n\nMalts: Pale, Munich and Malted Wheat.\n\nHops: Crystal and Cascade.",

              "beer_description": "By hook or by crook, James Squire always found a way to source the finest hops available for his flavoursome ales. Sometimes this resulted in a good lashing and other times in a handsome reward, but always in a good story to tell with a great-tasting beer.\n\nHop Thief American-style Pale Ale began as a Varietal Series – an occasional brew that started out as a chance for the James Squire brewers to experiment. It proved so popular that we’re delighted to now make it a welcome addition to the core James Squire craft beer range. And unlike any other craft beer, this happily hop-heavy brew has the ability to keep reinventing itself (much like James Squire himself) thanks to its changing, evolving hop bill. \n\nIt’s particularly exciting because it means this beer always promises an element of surprise. Having a craft beer that keeps changing its core ingredient on a regular basis to take advantage of the wonderful range of hop varieties from around the world makes an already special beer even more special. And you can bet James Squire would have approved of that!\n\nThe two hops that breathe life to the new brew are the quintessential American pale ale hop Cascade, which the gang at Malt Shovel Brewery have never used before, and Crystal hops, which bring the spice with floral aromas. Both are sourced from the base of the 9 million year old Yakima River, where hop producing began way back in 1872.\n\nMalts: Pale, Munich and Malted Wheat.\n\nHops: Crystal and Cascade.",

Sometimes this resulted in a good lashing and other times in a handsome reward, but always in a good story to tell with a great-tasting beer.\n\nHop Thief American-style Pale Ale began as a Varietal Series – an occasional brew that started out as a chance for the James Squire brewers to experiment. It proved so popular that we’re delighted to now make it a welcome addition to the core James Squire craft beer range. And unlike any other craft beer, this happily hop-heavy brew has the ability to keep reinventing itself (much like James Squire himself) thanks to its changing, evolving hop bill. \n\nIt’s particularly exciting because it means this beer always promises an element of surprise. Having a craft beer that keeps changing its core ingredient on a regular basis to take advantage of the wonderful range of hop varieties from around the world makes an already special beer even more special. And you can bet James Squire would have approved of that!\n\nThe two hops that breathe life to the new brew are the quintessential American pale ale hop Cascade, which the gang at Malt Shovel Brewery have never used before, and Crystal hops, which bring the spice with floral aromas. Both are sourced from the base of the 9 million year old Yakima River, where hop producing began way back in 1872.\n\nMalts: Pale, Munich and Malted Wheat.\n\nHops: Crystal and Cascade.",

Sometimes this resulted in a good lashing and other times in a handsome reward, but always in a good story to tell with a great-tasting beer.\n\nHop Thief American-style Pale Ale began as a Varietal Series – an occasional brew that started out as a chance for the James Squire brewers to experiment. It proved so popular that we’re delighted to now make it a welcome addition to the core James Squire craft beer range. And unlike any other craft beer, this happily hop-heavy brew has the ability to keep reinventing itself (much like James Squire himself) thanks to its changing, evolving hop bill. \n\nIt’s particularly exciting because it means this beer always promises an element of surprise. Having a craft beer that keeps changing its core ingredient on a regular basis to take advantage of the wonderful range of hop varieties from around the world makes an already special beer even more special. And you can bet James Squire would have approved of that!\n\nThe two hops that breathe life to the new brew are the quintessential American pale ale hop Cascade, which the gang at Malt Shovel Brewery have never used before, and Crystal hops, which bring the spice with floral aromas. Both are sourced from the base of the 9 million year old Yakima River, where hop producing began way back in 1872.\n\nMalts: Pale, Munich and Malted Wheat.\n\nHops: Crystal and Cascade.",

Sometimes this resulted in a good lashing and other times in a handsome reward, but always in a good story to tell with a great-tasting beer.\n\nHop Thief American-style Pale Ale began as a Varietal Series – an occasional brew that started out as a chance for the James Squire brewers to experiment. It proved so popular that we’re delighted to now make it a welcome addition to the core James Squire craft beer range. And unlike any other craft beer, this happily hop-heavy brew has the ability to keep reinventing itself (much like James Squire himself) thanks to its changing, evolving hop bill. \n\nIt’s particularly exciting because it means this beer always promises an element of surprise. Having a craft beer that keeps changing its core ingredient on a regular basis to take advantage of the wonderful range of hop varieties from around the world makes an already special beer even more special. And you can bet James Squire would have approved of that!\n\nThe two hops that breathe life to the new brew are the quintessential American pale ale hop Cascade, which the gang at Malt Shovel Brewery have never used before, and Crystal hops, which bring the spice with floral aromas. Both are sourced from the base of the 9 million year old Yakima River, where hop producing began way back in 1872.\n\nMalts: Pale, Munich and Malted Wheat.\n\nHops: Crystal and Cascade.",
