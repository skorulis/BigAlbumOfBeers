Over the last few months we have been dialling in on a few processes with our IPAs in search of a certain profile we love about some of the IPAs we've had from our friends overseas. Twenty Something is by far the closest we've come to hitting that mark so we're stoked to share it with you. Expect soft and juicy notes of mango, peach and candied orange carried by a lush and creamy mouthfeel. The finish is juicy and fresh with not a hint of bitterness in sight.",

Over the last few months we have been dialling in on a few processes with our IPAs in search of a certain profile we love about some of the IPAs we've had from our friends overseas. Twenty Something is by far the closest we've come to hitting that mark so we're stoked to share it with you. Expect soft and juicy notes of mango, peach and candied orange carried by a lush and creamy mouthfeel. The finish is juicy and fresh with not a hint of bitterness in sight.",

Twenty Something is by far the closest we've come to hitting that mark so we're stoked to share it with you. Expect soft and juicy notes of mango, peach and candied orange carried by a lush and creamy mouthfeel. The finish is juicy and fresh with not a hint of bitterness in sight.",
