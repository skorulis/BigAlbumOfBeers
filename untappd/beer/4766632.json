There's nowhere to hide faults, if something's a little off, everyone knows.\" \r\n\r\nThis Pils is one we've been working on for a little while now, with a few variations in the past not quite hitting the mark. We eventually settled on Weyermann Eraclea as the base malt, Czech grown Saaz hops and a long lagering time, keep it simple ?.\r\n\r\nCrisp and aromatic we couldn't be happier with the results. Enjoy with family, friends and whenever you need a break between your Double Hazy IPA's.",

We eventually settled on Weyermann Eraclea as the base malt, Czech grown Saaz hops and a long lagering time, keep it simple ?.\r\n\r\nCrisp and aromatic we couldn't be happier with the results.

There's nowhere to hide faults, if something's a little off, everyone knows.\" \r\n\r\nThis Pils is one we've been working on for a little while now, with a few variations in the past not quite hitting the mark. We eventually settled on Weyermann Eraclea as the base malt, Czech grown Saaz hops and a long lagering time, keep it simple ?.\r\n\r\nCrisp and aromatic we couldn't be happier with the results. Enjoy with family, friends and whenever you need a break between your Double Hazy IPA's.",
