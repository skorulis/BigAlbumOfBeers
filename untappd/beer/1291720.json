Sonic Prayer is a tribute to brewer Dennis' favourite band, American psychedelic rockers Earthless, whose first album bore the same name.

Following fermentation \"the humulus heavens opened up and rained down upon her a torrent of American and Australian hops\" too.\n\nAs a result, the drinker can \"expect mind altering, reverberating, aromas of citrus, peach, passionfruit, stone fruit and pine followed by an unstinting malt body and bitterness.\" Peace out, brothers and sisters.",

Sonic Prayer is a tribute to brewer Dennis' favourite band, American psychedelic rockers Earthless, whose first album bore the same name. It's described as \"a psychedelic conglomeration of the holiest of ingredients\", which in earthly terms means \"a skeleton\" of English and German malts into which \"life was then breathed [by] ungodly amounts of American and Kiwi hops\". Following fermentation \"the humulus heavens opened up and rained down upon her a torrent of American and Australian hops\" too.\n\nAs a result, the drinker can \"expect mind altering, reverberating, aromas of citrus, peach, passionfruit, stone fruit and pine followed by an unstinting malt body and bitterness.\" Peace out, brothers and sisters.",

Sonic Prayer is a tribute to brewer Dennis' favourite band, American psychedelic rockers Earthless, whose first album bore the same name. It's described as \"a psychedelic conglomeration of the holiest of ingredients\", which in earthly terms means \"a skeleton\" of English and German malts into which \"life was then breathed [by] ungodly amounts of American and Kiwi hops\". Following fermentation \"the humulus heavens opened up and rained down upon her a torrent of American and Australian hops\" too.\n\nAs a result, the drinker can \"expect mind altering, reverberating, aromas of citrus, peach, passionfruit, stone fruit and pine followed by an unstinting malt body and bitterness.\" Peace out, brothers and sisters.",

It's described as \"a psychedelic conglomeration of the holiest of ingredients\", which in earthly terms means \"a skeleton\" of English and German malts into which \"life was then breathed [by] ungodly amounts of American and Kiwi hops\". Following fermentation \"the humulus heavens opened up and rained down upon her a torrent of American and Australian hops\" too.\n\nAs a result, the drinker can \"expect mind altering, reverberating, aromas of citrus, peach, passionfruit, stone fruit and pine followed by an unstinting malt body and bitterness.\" Peace out, brothers and sisters.",
