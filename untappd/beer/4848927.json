The brief for this one was something people could crush all week long and we think that's been nailed. Brewed with Galaxy flowers in the whirlpool and the generously dry-hopped with the Mosaic Cryo and Nelson Sauvin from Bellwoods Ghost Orchid, and Nectaron and Citra being two of our favourite hops from this year so far. We've got a super juicy and ultimately crushable IPA that flows through with notes of papaya, nectarine, orange cream and bright citrus. It's one of the softest IPA's we've brewed to date with not a hint of bitterness, just fresh, juicy magic. \r\n",

The brief for this one was something people could crush all week long and we think that's been nailed. Brewed with Galaxy flowers in the whirlpool and the generously dry-hopped with the Mosaic Cryo and Nelson Sauvin from Bellwoods Ghost Orchid, and Nectaron and Citra being two of our favourite hops from this year so far. We've got a super juicy and ultimately crushable IPA that flows through with notes of papaya, nectarine, orange cream and bright citrus. It's one of the softest IPA's we've brewed to date with not a hint of bitterness, just fresh, juicy magic. \r\n",

The brief for this one was something people could crush all week long and we think that's been nailed. Brewed with Galaxy flowers in the whirlpool and the generously dry-hopped with the Mosaic Cryo and Nelson Sauvin from Bellwoods Ghost Orchid, and Nectaron and Citra being two of our favourite hops from this year so far. We've got a super juicy and ultimately crushable IPA that flows through with notes of papaya, nectarine, orange cream and bright citrus. It's one of the softest IPA's we've brewed to date with not a hint of bitterness, just fresh, juicy magic. \r\n",

We've got a super juicy and ultimately crushable IPA that flows through with notes of papaya, nectarine, orange cream and bright citrus.

Brewed with Galaxy flowers in the whirlpool and the generously dry-hopped with the Mosaic Cryo and Nelson Sauvin from Bellwoods Ghost Orchid, and Nectaron and Citra being two of our favourite hops from this year so far. We've got a super juicy and ultimately crushable IPA that flows through with notes of papaya, nectarine, orange cream and bright citrus. It's one of the softest IPA's we've brewed to date with not a hint of bitterness, just fresh, juicy magic. \r\n",
