It was traditionally brewed by farmers and their workers as a beverage to consume during the summer months.\n\nBridge Road Brewers have crafted their own Saison to add to their Chevalier range. This beer is quite unique, light straw in colour, with a tight bright white head. Aromas are dominated by esters and phenolic characters, owing to the Saison yeast strain, which also gives the beer its characteristic tart, dry and acidic profile.\n\nThis citrus character combined with grassy hop flavours make this a great food beer, try it with anything from seafood to blue cheese.\n",

It was traditionally brewed by farmers and their workers as a beverage to consume during the summer months.\n\nBridge Road Brewers have crafted their own Saison to add to their Chevalier range. This beer is quite unique, light straw in colour, with a tight bright white head. Aromas are dominated by esters and phenolic characters, owing to the Saison yeast strain, which also gives the beer its characteristic tart, dry and acidic profile.\n\nThis citrus character combined with grassy hop flavours make this a great food beer, try it with anything from seafood to blue cheese.\n",
