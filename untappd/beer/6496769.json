Light in body but rich in character, it’s bold without heaviness – a stout that invites another round.\r\nBuilt on pale malt with flaked barley for body, layered with roast barley, Carafa Special II, and chocolate malt, then lightly hopped with Loral for a subtle earthy edge. At 4.5% ABV and 30 IBUs, it’s brewed clean and true to style – smooth, dry, and endlessly drinkable.\r\nPairs beautifully with oysters, beef pies, and BBQ brisket where roast and char play in harmony.
