Without any kettle addition we soaked Idaho7 and Mosaic at 66oC for 1 hour in the fermenter, prior to knock out. This allowed us to extract hop compounds without isomerisation. It also promotes the expulsion of myrcene, that overpowering onion/garlic thing you get in some hops. Once this dominant flavour is removed, the more subtle hop notes come to the fore.\r\n \r\nStone fruit, lime and some delicate tropical notes are backed up by a savoury malt character. A huge, silky body delivers resin, alcohol warmth and a firm bitterness for balance. Flavour here and there and everywhere. Strong and subtle, this is one that could be too easily quaffed, to your detriment. Be careful! Because sometimes more is more.",

It also promotes the expulsion of myrcene, that overpowering onion/garlic thing you get in some hops. Once this dominant flavour is removed, the more subtle hop notes come to the fore.\r\n \r\nStone fruit, lime and some delicate tropical notes are backed up by a savoury malt character. A huge, silky body delivers resin, alcohol warmth and a firm bitterness for balance. Flavour here and there and everywhere. Strong and subtle, this is one that could be too easily quaffed, to your detriment. Be careful! Because sometimes more is more.",

Without any kettle addition we soaked Idaho7 and Mosaic at 66oC for 1 hour in the fermenter, prior to knock out. This allowed us to extract hop compounds without isomerisation. It also promotes the expulsion of myrcene, that overpowering onion/garlic thing you get in some hops. Once this dominant flavour is removed, the more subtle hop notes come to the fore.\r\n \r\nStone fruit, lime and some delicate tropical notes are backed up by a savoury malt character. A huge, silky body delivers resin, alcohol warmth and a firm bitterness for balance. Flavour here and there and everywhere. Strong and subtle, this is one that could be too easily quaffed, to your detriment. Be careful! Because sometimes more is more.",
