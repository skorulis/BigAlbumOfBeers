These are balanced with a smooth and velvety mouthfeel from the selection of roasted malts that give hints of caramel, toffee and hazelnut, finishing with a firm bitterness.\r\n\r\nMalts: Carared, Caramunich 2, Munich and Carafa\r\n\r\nHops: Galaxy, Enigma and Mosaic",

These are balanced with a smooth and velvety mouthfeel from the selection of roasted malts that give hints of caramel, toffee and hazelnut, finishing with a firm bitterness.\r\n\r\nMalts: Carared, Caramunich 2, Munich and Carafa\r\n\r\nHops: Galaxy, Enigma and Mosaic",
