Before you know it, you're fully airborne; you're caught in a hurricane of palm trees and houses and livestock, you can even see the faint figure of Helen Hunt pursuing you in her pickup truck down below.\r\n\r\nNow imagine that, but in a beer. You crack the can and aromas of tropical fruit immediately begin to escape. You pour it; it's thick and juicy and turbid. The faint aromas become a barrage of fruit as you bring it in for your first sip. On the palate you're greeted with a maelstrom of mango, a plethora of pineapple, and a cavalcade of coconut. There's a raft of other notes - lime and citrus, fresh grapefruit, melon - more to discover with each sip. A moderate malt backbone and subtle bitterness, however, keep you anchored. The storm calms and you get to enjoy the lush, velvety mouthfeel and the gentle sweetness imparted by the fresh mango. 'That was fun', you think. 'Better have another.'",

You crack the can and aromas of tropical fruit immediately begin to escape. You pour it; it's thick and juicy and turbid. The faint aromas become a barrage of fruit as you bring it in for your first sip. On the palate you're greeted with a maelstrom of mango, a plethora of pineapple, and a cavalcade of coconut. There's a raft of other notes - lime and citrus, fresh grapefruit, melon - more to discover with each sip. A moderate malt backbone and subtle bitterness, however, keep you anchored. The storm calms and you get to enjoy the lush, velvety mouthfeel and the gentle sweetness imparted by the fresh mango. 'That was fun', you think. 'Better have another.'",

Before you know it, you're fully airborne; you're caught in a hurricane of palm trees and houses and livestock, you can even see the faint figure of Helen Hunt pursuing you in her pickup truck down below.\r\n\r\nNow imagine that, but in a beer. You crack the can and aromas of tropical fruit immediately begin to escape. You pour it; it's thick and juicy and turbid. The faint aromas become a barrage of fruit as you bring it in for your first sip. On the palate you're greeted with a maelstrom of mango, a plethora of pineapple, and a cavalcade of coconut. There's a raft of other notes - lime and citrus, fresh grapefruit, melon - more to discover with each sip. A moderate malt backbone and subtle bitterness, however, keep you anchored. The storm calms and you get to enjoy the lush, velvety mouthfeel and the gentle sweetness imparted by the fresh mango. 'That was fun', you think. 'Better have another.'",

Before you know it, you're fully airborne; you're caught in a hurricane of palm trees and houses and livestock, you can even see the faint figure of Helen Hunt pursuing you in her pickup truck down below.\r\n\r\nNow imagine that, but in a beer. You crack the can and aromas of tropical fruit immediately begin to escape. You pour it; it's thick and juicy and turbid. The faint aromas become a barrage of fruit as you bring it in for your first sip. On the palate you're greeted with a maelstrom of mango, a plethora of pineapple, and a cavalcade of coconut. There's a raft of other notes - lime and citrus, fresh grapefruit, melon - more to discover with each sip. A moderate malt backbone and subtle bitterness, however, keep you anchored. The storm calms and you get to enjoy the lush, velvety mouthfeel and the gentle sweetness imparted by the fresh mango. 'That was fun', you think. 'Better have another.'",

The faint aromas become a barrage of fruit as you bring it in for your first sip. On the palate you're greeted with a maelstrom of mango, a plethora of pineapple, and a cavalcade of coconut. There's a raft of other notes - lime and citrus, fresh grapefruit, melon - more to discover with each sip. A moderate malt backbone and subtle bitterness, however, keep you anchored. The storm calms and you get to enjoy the lush, velvety mouthfeel and the gentle sweetness imparted by the fresh mango. 'That was fun', you think. 'Better have another.'",

You crack the can and aromas of tropical fruit immediately begin to escape. You pour it; it's thick and juicy and turbid. The faint aromas become a barrage of fruit as you bring it in for your first sip. On the palate you're greeted with a maelstrom of mango, a plethora of pineapple, and a cavalcade of coconut.

You crack the can and aromas of tropical fruit immediately begin to escape. You pour it; it's thick and juicy and turbid. The faint aromas become a barrage of fruit as you bring it in for your first sip. On the palate you're greeted with a maelstrom of mango, a plethora of pineapple, and a cavalcade of coconut. There's a raft of other notes - lime and citrus, fresh grapefruit, melon - more to discover with each sip. A moderate malt backbone and subtle bitterness, however, keep you anchored.
