Bling, is a huge beer, with all the bells and whistles. This ale is armed to the teeth with hops and studded with 24 carrot modified malts. At Bridge Road we've gone all out to make an IPA that screams hops and malt but still keeps balance in mind. Try matching this beer it with anything spicy or enjoy this malt and hop mouth full on its own. We love it, and hope you can too.",

Bling, is a huge beer, with all the bells and whistles. This ale is armed to the teeth with hops and studded with 24 carrot modified malts. At Bridge Road we've gone all out to make an IPA that screams hops and malt but still keeps balance in mind. Try matching this beer it with anything spicy or enjoy this malt and hop mouth full on its own. We love it, and hope you can too.",
