Working with our friends at Coffee Lab on Auckland's North Shore, we added Ethiopian de Genet coffee ​beans roasted to perfection which lend round fruit notes to the body. With an off-white, sustained head upfront, expect soft, citrus-laced coffee notes on the nose with lingering cocoa bolstered by smooth oat & toast on the palate to distinct, lasting peat smoke on the finish.\r\n\r\nLast Light is special brew made for GABS 2019.

Working with our friends at Coffee Lab on Auckland's North Shore, we added Ethiopian de Genet coffee ​beans roasted to perfection which lend round fruit notes to the body. With an off-white, sustained head upfront, expect soft, citrus-laced coffee notes on the nose with lingering cocoa bolstered by smooth oat & toast on the palate to distinct, lasting peat smoke on the finish.\r\n\r\nLast Light is special brew made for GABS 2019. It's also one of five beers included in special GABS packs available exclusively at Dan Murphy's stores throughout Australia. \r\n",

Working with our friends at Coffee Lab on Auckland's North Shore, we added Ethiopian de Genet coffee ​beans roasted to perfection which lend round fruit notes to the body. With an off-white, sustained head upfront, expect soft, citrus-laced coffee notes on the nose with lingering cocoa bolstered by smooth oat & toast on the palate to distinct, lasting peat smoke on the finish.\r\n\r\nLast Light is special brew made for GABS 2019. It's also one of five beers included in special GABS packs available exclusively at Dan Murphy's stores throughout Australia. \r\n",

Working with our friends at Coffee Lab on Auckland's North Shore, we added Ethiopian de Genet coffee ​beans roasted to perfection which lend round fruit notes to the body. With an off-white, sustained head upfront, expect soft, citrus-laced coffee notes on the nose with lingering cocoa bolstered by smooth oat & toast on the palate to distinct, lasting peat smoke on the finish.\r\n\r\nLast Light is special brew made for GABS 2019. It's also one of five beers included in special GABS packs available exclusively at Dan Murphy's stores throughout Australia. \r\n",
