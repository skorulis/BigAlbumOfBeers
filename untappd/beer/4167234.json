Heaps Deep started off as a much wetter mash than normal and went through a lengthy 2 step mash rest for the sake making sure the brew day was as long as possible. Post boil Heaps Deep received a massive Crystal and Sultana whirlpool addition in an effort to drive up our favourite pink grapefruit, citrus peel flavours and aromas. Further she was fermented on HEAPS more Crystal and Sultana followed by generous additions of Amarillo Cryo, Centennial, Centennial Cryo, Lemon Drop and Simcoe Cryo hops. We added the gentlest kiss of lactose to this beer to push up the pink lemonade and key lime pie vibes.",

Heaps Deep started off as a much wetter mash than normal and went through a lengthy 2 step mash rest for the sake making sure the brew day was as long as possible. Post boil Heaps Deep received a massive Crystal and Sultana whirlpool addition in an effort to drive up our favourite pink grapefruit, citrus peel flavours and aromas. Further she was fermented on HEAPS more Crystal and Sultana followed by generous additions of Amarillo Cryo, Centennial, Centennial Cryo, Lemon Drop and Simcoe Cryo hops. We added the gentlest kiss of lactose to this beer to push up the pink lemonade and key lime pie vibes.",

Heaps Deep started off as a much wetter mash than normal and went through a lengthy 2 step mash rest for the sake making sure the brew day was as long as possible. Post boil Heaps Deep received a massive Crystal and Sultana whirlpool addition in an effort to drive up our favourite pink grapefruit, citrus peel flavours and aromas. Further she was fermented on HEAPS more Crystal and Sultana followed by generous additions of Amarillo Cryo, Centennial, Centennial Cryo, Lemon Drop and Simcoe Cryo hops. We added the gentlest kiss of lactose to this beer to push up the pink lemonade and key lime pie vibes.",

Heaps Deep started off as a much wetter mash than normal and went through a lengthy 2 step mash rest for the sake making sure the brew day was as long as possible. Post boil Heaps Deep received a massive Crystal and Sultana whirlpool addition in an effort to drive up our favourite pink grapefruit, citrus peel flavours and aromas. Further she was fermented on HEAPS more Crystal and Sultana followed by generous additions of Amarillo Cryo, Centennial, Centennial Cryo, Lemon Drop and Simcoe Cryo hops. We added the gentlest kiss of lactose to this beer to push up the pink lemonade and key lime pie vibes.",
