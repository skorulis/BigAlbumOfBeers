We'd like to think the NZ hop growers would get around a few pints of this one during their upcoming harvest.",

Hopco wanted to give some lesser known hop varieties some exposure so the following blend of hops were chosen: NZ Cascade, Motueka and Pacifica which together combine to give the beer a rich key lime pie / lemon curd cheesecake aroma and a light resinous character on the palate all backed up by a satisfying whack of bitterness. We'd like to think the NZ hop growers would get around a few pints of this one during their upcoming harvest.",
