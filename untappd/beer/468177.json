How the tables were turned!\n\nThis beautifully coloured brew takes one of the most intriguing stories from James Squire’s life – his time as a regional district constable and puts a tasty twist on it. Brewed as a tribute to James’ transformation from con to cop.\n\nThe Constable is a deep-golden English-style ale, with a balanced nose of floral, citrus and earthy notes, a firm backbone of crystal and pale malts and a lingering hop bitterness.\n\nAccording to Rob ‘Freshy’ Freshwater, Senior Brewer at the Malt Shovel Brewery, it’s ‘a flavoursome beverage for all to enjoy’. At 3.4 per cent alcohol per volume, the Constable is true to its inspiration and a classic thirst-quencher.\n\nFreshy also recommends locking away a Constable or two with a nice rich red meat like lamb to match the crystal malts within the beer, followed by the cleansing characteristics of the hops coming through to provide the balance.\n\nAll in all, we’re confident that both craft beer newbies and long-time fans of the James Squire range will find the Constable mid-strength Copper Ale an arresting experience.\n\nMalts: Pale, Munich and Crystal\n\nHops: Galaxy & Topaz","beer_style":"Bitter - Session \/ Ordinary","has_had":false,"beer_active":1},"brewery":{"brewery_id":820,"brewery_name":"Malt Shovel Brewery","brewery_slug":"malt-shovel-brewery","brewery_page_url":"\/JamesSquireMaltShovelBrewery","brewery_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/brewery_logos\/brewery-MaltShovelBrewery_820.jpeg","country_name":"Australia","contact":{"twitter":"","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/jamessquire","url":"https:\/\/www.jamessquire.com.au\/"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Camperdown","brewery_state":"New South Wales","lat":-33.8867,"lng":151.175},"brewery_active":1},"venue":{"venue_id":7730089,"venue_name":"The Squire's Landing","venue_slug":"the-squire-s-landing","primary_category_key":"Dining and Drinking","primary_category":"Dining and Drinking","parent_category_id":"63be6904847c3692a84b9bb5","categories":{"count":3,"items":[{"category_key":"brewery","category_name":"Brewery","category_id":"50327c8591d4c4b30a586d5d","is_primary":true},{"category_key":"australian_restaurant","category_name":"Australian Restaurant","category_id":"4bf58dd8d48988d169941735","is_primary":false},{"category_key":"scenic_lookout","category_name":"Scenic Lookout","category_id":"4bf58dd8d48988d165941735","is_primary":false}]},"location":{"venue_address":"10 Circular Quay W","venue_city":"Sydney","venue_state":"NSW","venue_country":"Australia","lat":-33.8573456,"lng":151.2102203},"contact":{"twitter":"@squires_landing","venue_url":"https:\/\/www.jamessquire.com.au\/brewhouses\/the-squires-landing"},"foursquare":{"foursquare_id":"5b04952bc84d180024ce29d8","foursquare_url":"https:\/\/4sq.com\/2s4zfOT"},"venue_icon":{"sm":"https:\/\/ss3.4sqi.net\/img\/categories_v2\/food\/brewery_bg_64.png","md":"https:\/\/ss3.4sqi.net\/img\/categories_v2\/food\/brewery_bg_88.png","lg":"https:\/\/ss3.4sqi.net\/img\/categories_v2\/food\/brewery_bg_512.png"},"is_verified":false,"spotlights":[],"has_beer":false,"has_food":false,"has_wine":false,"has_spirits":false},"comments":{"total_count":0,"count":0,"items":[]},"toasts":{"total_count":0,"count":0,"auth_toast":false,"items":[]},"media":{"count":1,"items":[{"photo_id":409644570,"photo":{"photo_img_sm":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/photos\/2022_01_29\/30415babcd83ae40cf1d8b1c35654a68_200x200.jpg","photo_img_md":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/photos\/2022_01_29\/30415babcd83ae40cf1d8b1c35654a68_640x640.jpg","photo_img_lg":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/photos\/2022_01_29\/30415babcd83ae40cf1d8b1c35654a68_1280x1280.jpg","photo_img_og":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/photos\/2022_01_29\/30415babcd83ae40cf1d8b1c35654a68_raw.jpg"}}]},"source":{"app_name":"Untappd for iPhone - (V2)","app_website":"http:\/\/untpd.it\/iphoneapp"},"badges":{"count":0,"items":[]}},{"checkin_id":1056119733,"created_at":"Sat, 24 Jul 2021 01:19:25 +0000","checkin_comment":"","rating_score":3.25,"user":{"uid":569506,"user_name":"MitchM_Beer","first_name":"Mitch","last_name":"","location":"","url":"","is_supporter":1,"bio":"Beeyeeeer","relationship":null,"user_avatar":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/profile\/77041d1e03ed0ca96749c1d7534180dd_100x100.jpg","is_private":0,"public_toasts":1},"beer":{"bid":468177,"beer_name":"James Squire The Constable","beer_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/beer_logos\/beer-468177_305a1_sm.jpeg","beer_abv":3.4,"beer_ibu":28,"beer_slug":"malt-shovel-brewery-james-squire-the-constable","beer_description":"From chicken thief and convict to wealthy farmer and brewer, James Squire’s life was certainly eventful – and, it seems, not without irony.
