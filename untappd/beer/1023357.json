Piny, resinous American hop notes fade way to reveal its rich roasty, chocolaty malt body.\n\nIn your mouth\nPhat Mongrels assertive hop flavour and 70 IBUs of bitterness will have you gagging for more.

Piny, resinous American hop notes fade way to reveal its rich roasty, chocolaty malt body.\n\nIn your mouth\nPhat Mongrels assertive hop flavour and 70 IBUs of bitterness will have you gagging for more. The gentle alcohol warmth at 6.5% ABV and sweet Phat Chocolate and roast malt flavours will leave you well satisfied and content.\n\n",

Piny, resinous American hop notes fade way to reveal its rich roasty, chocolaty malt body.\n\nIn your mouth\nPhat Mongrels assertive hop flavour and 70 IBUs of bitterness will have you gagging for more. The gentle alcohol warmth at 6.5% ABV and sweet Phat Chocolate and roast malt flavours will leave you well satisfied and content.\n\n",

Piny, resinous American hop notes fade way to reveal its rich roasty, chocolaty malt body.\n\nIn your mouth\nPhat Mongrels assertive hop flavour and 70 IBUs of bitterness will have you gagging for more. The gentle alcohol warmth at 6.5% ABV and sweet Phat Chocolate and roast malt flavours will leave you well satisfied and content.\n\n",

Piny, resinous American hop notes fade way to reveal its rich roasty, chocolaty malt body.\n\nIn your mouth\nPhat Mongrels assertive hop flavour and 70 IBUs of bitterness will have you gagging for more. The gentle alcohol warmth at 6.5% ABV and sweet Phat Chocolate and roast malt flavours will leave you well satisfied and content.\n\n",
