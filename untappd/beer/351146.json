Following on from the success of White Rabbit Red and White Rabbit Dark Ale Brewers Cut comes their latest creation, the flavoursome White Rabbit Teddywidder. A Berliner Weisse-style beer, Teddywidder is made from the wort of the white ale, and has a deliciously tart and tangy flavour profile. Its subtle flavours make it perfect to drink by itself, but also exceedingly conducive to flavouring with fruit syrups or purees for complexity, balance and fun.\n\nOriginally brewed for the Great Australasian Beer Festival 2013. Teddywidderhas been released again in in 2017 in large bottles as a \"Barrel Hall Release\".",

Following on from the success of White Rabbit Red and White Rabbit Dark Ale Brewers Cut comes their latest creation, the flavoursome White Rabbit Teddywidder. A Berliner Weisse-style beer, Teddywidder is made from the wort of the white ale, and has a deliciously tart and tangy flavour profile. Its subtle flavours make it perfect to drink by itself, but also exceedingly conducive to flavouring with fruit syrups or purees for complexity, balance and fun.\n\nOriginally brewed for the Great Australasian Beer Festival 2013. Teddywidderhas been released again in in 2017 in large bottles as a \"Barrel Hall Release\".",
