You could say he was an archetypal jack of all trades, but to give credit where credit is due – he was a master of many too.\n\nFrom this man of many tastes and talents comes Jack of Spades Porter. Utterly unique, it has a more delicate complexity than a regular stout with its rich black colour, coffee and chocolate aroma and pillowy head.\n\nJack of Spades Porter is perfect for colder winter months and pairs with hearty roast beef and Yorkshire pudding, porterhouse steak or take it to your dessert course and match it with a chocolate mud cake, double cream and raspberries.\n\nMalts: Pale, Crystal, Chocolate and Roasted Wheat.\n\nHops: Dr Rudi",

But James Squire was never one to shy away from a challenge or try his hand at something new, quickly building a fortune from his brewery and tavern. You could say he was an archetypal jack of all trades, but to give credit where credit is due – he was a master of many too.\n\nFrom this man of many tastes and talents comes Jack of Spades Porter. Utterly unique, it has a more delicate complexity than a regular stout with its rich black colour, coffee and chocolate aroma and pillowy head.\n\nJack of Spades Porter is perfect for colder winter months and pairs with hearty roast beef and Yorkshire pudding, porterhouse steak or take it to your dessert course and match it with a chocolate mud cake, double cream and raspberries.\n\nMalts: Pale, Crystal, Chocolate and Roasted Wheat.\n\nHops: Dr Rudi",

But James Squire was never one to shy away from a challenge or try his hand at something new, quickly building a fortune from his brewery and tavern. You could say he was an archetypal jack of all trades, but to give credit where credit is due – he was a master of many too.\n\nFrom this man of many tastes and talents comes Jack of Spades Porter. Utterly unique, it has a more delicate complexity than a regular stout with its rich black colour, coffee and chocolate aroma and pillowy head.\n\nJack of Spades Porter is perfect for colder winter months and pairs with hearty roast beef and Yorkshire pudding, porterhouse steak or take it to your dessert course and match it with a chocolate mud cake, double cream and raspberries.\n\nMalts: Pale, Crystal, Chocolate and Roasted Wheat.\n\nHops: Dr Rudi",
