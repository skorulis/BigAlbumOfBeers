      "beer_description": "This beer is just the job for anyone who appreciates beautifully engineered stuff that used to be made properly. So undo the top button of your pressed pits overalls, ease into the wingback and roll out a rare taste of a truly great British beer.\n\nOld Engine Oil is a remarkably smooth, creamy brew with a beautiful velvety mouthfeel. Enjoy flavours of coffee, slightly buttered toffee, dark chocolate and earthy hops. You may find some mild cherry fruit within the residual sweetness, neatly accompanying the roasted flavours that ride with you all the way to the finish.\n\nBorn in 2000, this winner of the first ever Tesco Beer Challenge was always designed to have a thick, dark, gloopy appearance. We piled in the oats to smooth out the bitterness from the roast barley and laid on a super-high-temperature mash to make the wort less fermentable. The result is a really black beer that has a greater sweetness and fuller flavour than many other stouts and porters, as well as a surprisingly light texture.\n\nHOPS: Galena, East Kent Goldings, Fuggles\n\nMALTS: Roast barley, oats",

So undo the top button of your pressed pits overalls, ease into the wingback and roll out a rare taste of a truly great British beer.\n\nOld Engine Oil is a remarkably smooth, creamy brew with a beautiful velvety mouthfeel. Enjoy flavours of coffee, slightly buttered toffee, dark chocolate and earthy hops. You may find some mild cherry fruit within the residual sweetness, neatly accompanying the roasted flavours that ride with you all the way to the finish.\n\nBorn in 2000, this winner of the first ever Tesco Beer Challenge was always designed to have a thick, dark, gloopy appearance. We piled in the oats to smooth out the bitterness from the roast barley and laid on a super-high-temperature mash to make the wort less fermentable. The result is a really black beer that has a greater sweetness and fuller flavour than many other stouts and porters, as well as a surprisingly light texture.\n\nHOPS: Galena, East Kent Goldings, Fuggles\n\nMALTS: Roast barley, oats",

We piled in the oats to smooth out the bitterness from the roast barley and laid on a super-high-temperature mash to make the wort less fermentable.

So undo the top button of your pressed pits overalls, ease into the wingback and roll out a rare taste of a truly great British beer.\n\nOld Engine Oil is a remarkably smooth, creamy brew with a beautiful velvety mouthfeel. Enjoy flavours of coffee, slightly buttered toffee, dark chocolate and earthy hops. You may find some mild cherry fruit within the residual sweetness, neatly accompanying the roasted flavours that ride with you all the way to the finish.\n\nBorn in 2000, this winner of the first ever Tesco Beer Challenge was always designed to have a thick, dark, gloopy appearance. We piled in the oats to smooth out the bitterness from the roast barley and laid on a super-high-temperature mash to make the wort less fermentable. The result is a really black beer that has a greater sweetness and fuller flavour than many other stouts and porters, as well as a surprisingly light texture.\n\nHOPS: Galena, East Kent Goldings, Fuggles\n\nMALTS: Roast barley, oats",

So undo the top button of your pressed pits overalls, ease into the wingback and roll out a rare taste of a truly great British beer.\n\nOld Engine Oil is a remarkably smooth, creamy brew with a beautiful velvety mouthfeel. Enjoy flavours of coffee, slightly buttered toffee, dark chocolate and earthy hops. You may find some mild cherry fruit within the residual sweetness, neatly accompanying the roasted flavours that ride with you all the way to the finish.\n\nBorn in 2000, this winner of the first ever Tesco Beer Challenge was always designed to have a thick, dark, gloopy appearance. We piled in the oats to smooth out the bitterness from the roast barley and laid on a super-high-temperature mash to make the wort less fermentable. The result is a really black beer that has a greater sweetness and fuller flavour than many other stouts and porters, as well as a surprisingly light texture.\n\nHOPS: Galena, East Kent Goldings, Fuggles\n\nMALTS: Roast barley, oats",
