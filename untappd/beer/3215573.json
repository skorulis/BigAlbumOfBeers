The cost is not paid in vain though - in return, she bestows upon beer lovers this fiendishly delicious Red IPA. \r\n\r\nOriginally brewed in collaboration with the Royal Albert Hotel, Queen of the Damned pours an enticingly deep blood-red hue, showcasing the specialty grains that give this beer it's beautifully rich, malty body. The Queen then delivers a generous hit of hops, with Citra and Centennial bringing citrus and bitterness for perfect balance and a dry finish. Once you've been bitten by the Queen, you won't be able to resist her calls and you'll be coming back for more. \r\n\r\n",

The cost is not paid in vain though - in return, she bestows upon beer lovers this fiendishly delicious Red IPA. \r\n\r\nOriginally brewed in collaboration with the Royal Albert Hotel, Queen of the Damned pours an enticingly deep blood-red hue, showcasing the specialty grains that give this beer it's beautifully rich, malty body. The Queen then delivers a generous hit of hops, with Citra and Centennial bringing citrus and bitterness for perfect balance and a dry finish. Once you've been bitten by the Queen, you won't be able to resist her calls and you'll be coming back for more. \r\n\r\n",
