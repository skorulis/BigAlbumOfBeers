Our neighbours at Westcombe Dairy make one of the finest Cheddars in the world and Madness balances its intensity and flavours perfectly.\r\n\r\nOur Madness IPA uses four classic American hops renowned for their citrus and resinous characteristics. Amarillo, Citra, Centennial and Columbus – used somewhat liberally in late hop and dry hop additions – make this beer what it is. We use a very simple malt bill, and a yeast with a very low flavour impact so that the hops can really shine.\r\n\r\nOpen the bottle to a tropical punchbowl of aromas, as this beer is all about the hops. There are masses and masses of late hops and dry hops to maximise the beautiful flavours and aromas, so you can experience wave after wave of tropical and citrus fruits.  ",
