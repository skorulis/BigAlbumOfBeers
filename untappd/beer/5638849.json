He's been a great friend of the brewery and so when he suggested we brew a special beer to celebrate the one year anniversary of his skate park opening, we jumped at the chance.\r\n\r\nFrankie fancied a wheat beer, so the starting point was our delicious Hefeweizen. But given the time of year, we wanted something a bit lighter and more refreshing. So we added a dose of corn to the malt bill and finished things off with American Cascade hops for a punch of citrus.
