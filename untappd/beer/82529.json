It also has three different malts: pale pilsner malt; caramalt for complexity and colour; and carapils for biscuit maltiness.\n\nBalmain Pilsner is well balanced with a rounded clean crisp finish, and is the perfect complement to seafood or on its own as an aperitif!",

It also has three different malts: pale pilsner malt; caramalt for complexity and colour; and carapils for biscuit maltiness.\n\nBalmain Pilsner is well balanced with a rounded clean crisp finish, and is the perfect complement to seafood or on its own as an aperitif!",

It also has three different malts: pale pilsner malt; caramalt for complexity and colour; and carapils for biscuit maltiness.\n\nBalmain Pilsner is well balanced with a rounded clean crisp finish, and is the perfect complement to seafood or on its own as an aperitif!",
