Our interpretation of this style combines old world malts and brewing processes with large additions of flavourful and charismatic American hops. Into the Green was brewed on a lean malt base of German and Kiwi pilsner malts. Its been assertively hopped in the kettle and whirlpool with Strata and Citra hops. Following fermentation it was dry hopped with Citra and Mosaic hops. Like all of our lagers this beer was fermented cold, is unfiltered and naturally carbonated. This beer was cold conditioned in tank for 10 weeks prior to packaging.",

Our interpretation of this style combines old world malts and brewing processes with large additions of flavourful and charismatic American hops. Into the Green was brewed on a lean malt base of German and Kiwi pilsner malts. Its been assertively hopped in the kettle and whirlpool with Strata and Citra hops. Following fermentation it was dry hopped with Citra and Mosaic hops. Like all of our lagers this beer was fermented cold, is unfiltered and naturally carbonated. This beer was cold conditioned in tank for 10 weeks prior to packaging.",
