Rich, dark and flavoursome but at the same time ever refreshing. Malt driven but with the aromatic lift of generous doses of hops.\n\nWith the help of traditional open fermentation tanks we let our Dark Ale yeast play... and it likes to play hard. Yeast normally does its thing in closed tanks that tends constrains it work, but with open tanks (that are just like a big soup tin without the lid), the yeast is allowed to run wild.\n\nRaisin like esters bind a balancing act of flavour with a malt bill that rewards the parched palate and delivers a rich, dark colour.\n\nPassed through a hop back laden with whole hop flowers prior to a liberal dry hopping regime during open fermentation, this is a dark ale with a generous amount of reassuring bitterness.",

Yeast normally does its thing in closed tanks that tends constrains it work, but with open tanks (that are just like a big soup tin without the lid), the yeast is allowed to run wild.\n\nRaisin like esters bind a balancing act of flavour with a malt bill that rewards the parched palate and delivers a rich, dark colour.\n\nPassed through a hop back laden with whole hop flowers prior to a liberal dry hopping regime during open fermentation, this is a dark ale with a generous amount of reassuring bitterness.",

Rich, dark and flavoursome but at the same time ever refreshing. Malt driven but with the aromatic lift of generous doses of hops.\n\nWith the help of traditional open fermentation tanks we let our Dark Ale yeast play... and it likes to play hard. Yeast normally does its thing in closed tanks that tends constrains it work, but with open tanks (that are just like a big soup tin without the lid), the yeast is allowed to run wild.\n\nRaisin like esters bind a balancing act of flavour with a malt bill that rewards the parched palate and delivers a rich, dark colour.\n\nPassed through a hop back laden with whole hop flowers prior to a liberal dry hopping regime during open fermentation, this is a dark ale with a generous amount of reassuring bitterness.",
