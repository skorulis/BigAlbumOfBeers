A Gose is a top fermented beer style from the German city of Leipzig, which uses at least 50% wheat in the grist, they are by definition tart, herbal and refreshing but what really characterises them is a defined saltiness which traditonally would have come from the particular water in the area they were brewed.\n\nWe’re not stupid enough to completely take on 100?s of years of German brewing tradition and regional knowledge so we’ve made a few changes to the method we will use in the production of the beer, all of which should give us the best chance of making the beer representative of the style.\n\nIn true collaborative spirit Anders felt we should also bring an Anglo-Danish element to the beer; we agreed and so we’ll be adding Gooseberries for some English fruit and tartness typical of the style. The Danish ingredients will be additions of Sea Buckthorn and Rosehips.",

A Gose is a top fermented beer style from the German city of Leipzig, which uses at least 50% wheat in the grist, they are by definition tart, herbal and refreshing but what really characterises them is a defined saltiness which traditonally would have come from the particular water in the area they were brewed.\n\nWe’re not stupid enough to completely take on 100?s of years of German brewing tradition and regional knowledge so we’ve made a few changes to the method we will use in the production of the beer, all of which should give us the best chance of making the beer representative of the style.\n\nIn true collaborative spirit Anders felt we should also bring an Anglo-Danish element to the beer; we agreed and so we’ll be adding Gooseberries for some English fruit and tartness typical of the style.

              "beer_description": "Time for our third new beer of 2013, and continuing a theme from our Bavarian Pils, ‘Dancing Bear’ we are brewing another traditional German beer style, but one which will be relatively unknown to many UK beer drinkers.\n\nWe’re brewing a 'Gose' in collaboration with Danish master brewer Anders Kissmeyer. A Gose is a top fermented beer style from the German city of Leipzig, which uses at least 50% wheat in the grist, they are by definition tart, herbal and refreshing but what really characterises them is a defined saltiness which traditonally would have come from the particular water in the area they were brewed.\n\nWe’re not stupid enough to completely take on 100?s of years of German brewing tradition and regional knowledge so we’ve made a few changes to the method we will use in the production of the beer, all of which should give us the best chance of making the beer representative of the style.\n\nIn true collaborative spirit Anders felt we should also bring an Anglo-Danish element to the beer; we agreed and so we’ll be adding Gooseberries for some English fruit and tartness typical of the style. The Danish ingredients will be additions of Sea Buckthorn and Rosehips.",

              "beer_description": "Time for our third new beer of 2013, and continuing a theme from our Bavarian Pils, ‘Dancing Bear’ we are brewing another traditional German beer style, but one which will be relatively unknown to many UK beer drinkers.\n\nWe’re brewing a 'Gose' in collaboration with Danish master brewer Anders Kissmeyer. A Gose is a top fermented beer style from the German city of Leipzig, which uses at least 50% wheat in the grist, they are by definition tart, herbal and refreshing but what really characterises them is a defined saltiness which traditonally would have come from the particular water in the area they were brewed.\n\nWe’re not stupid enough to completely take on 100?s of years of German brewing tradition and regional knowledge so we’ve made a few changes to the method we will use in the production of the beer, all of which should give us the best chance of making the beer representative of the style.\n\nIn true collaborative spirit Anders felt we should also bring an Anglo-Danish element to the beer; we agreed and so we’ll be adding Gooseberries for some English fruit and tartness typical of the style. The Danish ingredients will be additions of Sea Buckthorn and Rosehips.",
