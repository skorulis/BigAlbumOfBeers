Anyone who has added a wedge of lemon to their pale Mexican lager will appreciate the character of this beer.\n\nPale straw gold in colour with a fluffy white head, our Gose tones back the salt and acidity to a balanced and thirst-quenching level that is accessible to all pallettes. We use a combination of Pilsner, wheat and acidulated malts, with subtle mineral & citrus notes and an ocean tang. We use salt harvested from the ocean in front of our farm and add locally sourced seaweed (Ulva Compressa – very similar to Sea Lettuce) for a minerally marine touch. This is one for the beach, and great for anyone who appreciates a lighter bodied refreshing beer that finishes dry and smooth.",

We use a combination of Pilsner, wheat and acidulated malts, with subtle mineral & citrus notes and an ocean tang. We use salt harvested from the ocean in front of our farm and add locally sourced seaweed (Ulva Compressa – very similar to Sea Lettuce) for a minerally marine touch.

We use a combination of Pilsner, wheat and acidulated malts, with subtle mineral & citrus notes and an ocean tang. We use salt harvested from the ocean in front of our farm and add locally sourced seaweed (Ulva Compressa – very similar to Sea Lettuce) for a minerally marine touch.

We use a combination of Pilsner, wheat and acidulated malts, with subtle mineral & citrus notes and an ocean tang. We use salt harvested from the ocean in front of our farm and add locally sourced seaweed (Ulva Compressa – very similar to Sea Lettuce) for a minerally marine touch. This is one for the beach, and great for anyone who appreciates a lighter bodied refreshing beer that finishes dry and smooth.",

Anyone who has added a wedge of lemon to their pale Mexican lager will appreciate the character of this beer.\n\nPale straw gold in colour with a fluffy white head, our Gose tones back the salt and acidity to a balanced and thirst-quenching level that is accessible to all pallettes. We use a combination of Pilsner, wheat and acidulated malts, with subtle mineral & citrus notes and an ocean tang. We use salt harvested from the ocean in front of our farm and add locally sourced seaweed (Ulva Compressa – very similar to Sea Lettuce) for a minerally marine touch. This is one for the beach, and great for anyone who appreciates a lighter bodied refreshing beer that finishes dry and smooth.",

We use a combination of Pilsner, wheat and acidulated malts, with subtle mineral & citrus notes and an ocean tang. We use salt harvested from the ocean in front of our farm and add locally sourced seaweed (Ulva Compressa – very similar to Sea Lettuce) for a minerally marine touch. This is one for the beach, and great for anyone who appreciates a lighter bodied refreshing beer that finishes dry and smooth.",
