So much importance is given to total sanitation, that the beer needs no pasteurization.  KEO is the only beer produced on the island, which is bottled unpasteurised. This same recipe and brewing process is strictly followed to date, preserving KEO Beer’s utmost quality.\n\nKEO is brewed from the finest malt and the choicest hops, traditionally matured, bottled fresh and unpasteurised, gold in colour and unique in taste. In March 1987, KEO Beer was awarded the Gold Medal by the Brewing Industry International Awards, at the World’s Bottled Lager Competition, held at Burton-on-Trent, UK.",

So much importance is given to total sanitation, that the beer needs no pasteurization.  KEO is the only beer produced on the island, which is bottled unpasteurised. This same recipe and brewing process is strictly followed to date, preserving KEO Beer’s utmost quality.\n\nKEO is brewed from the finest malt and the choicest hops, traditionally matured, bottled fresh and unpasteurised, gold in colour and unique in taste. In March 1987, KEO Beer was awarded the Gold Medal by the Brewing Industry International Awards, at the World’s Bottled Lager Competition, held at Burton-on-Trent, UK.",
