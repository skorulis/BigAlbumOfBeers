His nickname was the result of him losing his nose whilst working as a handsome & successful cab driver in Sydney throughout the 1870's. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, one of his horses was suffering from a bit of road rage & kicked him in the face, completely obliterating his nose! He was unemployed for a long time & out of desperation took on the state's first salaried hangman. \r\n\r\nYou can read more about the gruesome story of Nosey Bob at the Old Dubbo Gaol but word has it, he wasn't very good, however he did like a beer! Unfortunately for him, it is said that whenever he ventured out to his local, the publicans would smash any glass that he had drunk from as \"it would do my business no good if I gave men glasses into which Nosey Bob had dipped his nose - if he had one”.",

              "beer_description": "Loaded with American hop aromas that are to die for, that is well balanced with a great malt body.\r\n\r\nRobert \"Nosey Bob\" Howard had the rather gruesome job of being the NSW State Hangman & presided over seven executions at the Old Dubbo Gaol in the late 1800's. His nickname was the result of him losing his nose whilst working as a handsome & successful cab driver in Sydney throughout the 1870's. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, one of his horses was suffering from a bit of road rage & kicked him in the face, completely obliterating his nose! He was unemployed for a long time & out of desperation took on the state's first salaried hangman. \r\n\r\nYou can read more about the gruesome story of Nosey Bob at the Old Dubbo Gaol but word has it, he wasn't very good, however he did like a beer! Unfortunately for him, it is said that whenever he ventured out to his local, the publicans would smash any glass that he had drunk from as \"it would do my business no good if I gave men glasses into which Nosey Bob had dipped his nose - if he had one”.",
