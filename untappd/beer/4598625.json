This guy was kettle soured with lactobacillus plantarum and refermented on blood orange. The aroma is a fruit salad of ruby grapefruit, blood orange, mandarin and lemon.

We brewed this with a tip of the hat to more traditional times, when Gose beers were unfined, unfiltered and carbonation was naturally derived.\r\n\r\nA 60:40 Ale:Wheat grain bill provides a huge proteinaceous and tart malty base. This guy was kettle soured with lactobacillus plantarum and refermented on blood orange. The aroma is a fruit salad of ruby grapefruit, blood orange, mandarin and lemon. While a salty mid-palate gives fullness and helps to balance the sour finish.  ",
