Thankfully for us, James Squire was a far better brewer than he was a thief.\r\n\r\nLaunched in 2011, this thirst-quenching Australian pale ale has proved a hit with customers around the country. This clean-finishing craft beer may be cloudy in appearance, but there’s nothing cloudy about the taste.\r\n\r\nMalted wheat adds refreshing character, while the fruity infusion makes for an enticing aroma. \r\n\r\nWhether you’re enjoying a fresh cut of meat or a tempting smorgasbord of seafood and fresh produce, you’ll want one of these straw-coloured beauties as the perfect complement to a casual feast.\r\n\r\nJames Squire One Fifty Lashes Pale Ale is also the ideal starting point for anyone looking to embark on a quest towards an appreciation of more flavourful beers. It’s a completely approachable craft brew that provides a gentle counterpoint to our more challenging Stowaway IPA.\r\n\r\nIronically, there was nothing gentle about the punishment James Squire received from the judge for stealing the ingredients that set him on the path to being Australia’s first and most famous brewer. So is One Fifty Lashes a beer as legendary as the story it’s named after? We’ll let you be the judge of that.\r\n\r\nMalts: Pale, Munich and Wheat\r\n\r\nHops: Amarillo, Willamette, Nelson Sauvin and Galaxy","beer_style":"Pale Ale - Australian","has_had":false,"beer_active":1},"brewery":{"brewery_id":820,"brewery_name":"Malt Shovel Brewery","brewery_slug":"malt-shovel-brewery","brewery_page_url":"\/JamesSquireMaltShovelBrewery","brewery_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/brewery_logos\/brewery-MaltShovelBrewery_820.jpeg","country_name":"Australia","contact":{"twitter":"","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/jamessquire","url":"https:\/\/www.jamessquire.com.au\/"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Camperdown","brewery_state":"New South Wales","lat":-33.8867,"lng":151.175},"brewery_active":1},"venue":{"venue_id":9917985,"venue_name":"Untappd at Home","venue_slug":"at-home","primary_category_key":null,"primary_category":null,"parent_category_id":"4e67e38e036454776db1fb3a","categories":{"count":1,"items":[{"category_key":"home_private","category_name":"Home (private)","category_id":"4bf58dd8d48988d103941735","is_primary":true}]},"location":{"venue_address":"","venue_city":"","venue_state":"NC","venue_country":"United States","lat":34.2346611,"lng":-77.9482117},"contact":{"twitter":"","venue_url":""},"foursquare":{"foursquare_id":"5e7b4d99c91df60008e8b168","foursquare_url":"https:\/\/4sq.com\/3bDWYuq"},"venue_icon":{"sm":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/venuelogos\/venue_9917985_b3a5d245_bg_64.png","md":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/venuelogos\/venue_9917985_b3a5d245_bg_88.png","lg":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/venuelogos\/venue_9917985_b3a5d245_bg_176.png?v=1"},"is_verified":true,"spotlights":[],"has_beer":false,"has_food":false,"has_wine":false,"has_spirits":false},"comments":{"total_count":0,"count":0,"items":[]},"toasts":{"total_count":2,"count":2,"auth_toast":null,"items":[{"uid":3580246,"user":{"uid":3580246,"user_name":"Mass10","first_name":"Dan","last_name":"Massey","bio":"","location":"Dubai, UAE \/ Oxford, UK","relationship":"none","user_avatar":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/profile\/a02f7f404c0b4b19399e77058be308d6_100x100.jpg","account_type":"user","venue_details":[],"brewery_details":[]},"like_id":1600815299,"like_owner":false,"created_at":"Sat, 28 Dec 2024 19:57:31 +0000"},{"uid":10882366,"user":{"uid":10882366,"user_name":"Joe-Ed17","first_name":"Joe","last_name":"Edwards","bio":"","location":"Manchester ","relationship":"none","user_avatar":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/profile\/9f8f5ebc21a4167dd2a3f772be323205_100x100.jpg","account_type":"user","venue_details":[],"brewery_details":[]},"like_id":1600704269,"like_owner":false,"created_at":"Sat, 28 Dec 2024 17:46:32 +0000"}]},"media":{"count":1,"items":[{"photo_id":577003870,"photo":{"photo_img_sm":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=200&height=200&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2024_12_27\/82e4ae7a6a23d5a02f9aef21136dbeac_c_1445241300_raw.jpg","photo_img_md":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=640&height=640&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2024_12_27\/82e4ae7a6a23d5a02f9aef21136dbeac_c_1445241300_raw.jpg","photo_img_lg":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=1280&height=1280&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2024_12_27\/82e4ae7a6a23d5a02f9aef21136dbeac_c_1445241300_raw.jpg","photo_img_og":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/photos\/2024_12_27\/82e4ae7a6a23d5a02f9aef21136dbeac_c_1445241300_raw.jpg"}}]},"source":{"app_name":"Untappd for Android -
