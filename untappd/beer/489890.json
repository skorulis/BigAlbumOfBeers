But when our five brewers got together to debate their favourite hops, not surprisingly, there were five sides. Not quite a cube, but almost. \r\n\r\nSo rather than take sides, we were distinctly diplomatic and decided to create a brew that combined them all. \r\n\r\nStriking a balance that brought out the best characteristics of each hop, without compromising the others was about the toughest thing we’ve ever done. \r\n\r\nBut finally, everything lined up perfectly, to create this beautifully balanced, highly hoppy, strong pale ale. \r\n\r\nWhat’s in it? Just real beer ingredients and five amazing hops for our ‘fantastic five’ brewers.
