              "beer_description": "That it takes some guts to turn a small fortune into a large one almost goes without saying. When those guts recently belonged to someone else we have a story worth telling. In a frontier town like Brisbane in the 1890s, great riches dangled\r\nmercilessly before those who were prepared\r\nto compromise. A financial kickstart had only the small price of a carcass to butcher. Forgiveness, though, is surprisingly comprehensive when the price is right. A parcel of land here, a stately home there and voila, pillar-of-society! So here’s the glittering prize, the goldest of Golden Lagers, a reminder that low prices are just the beginning.\r\n\r\nTraditional malts and wheat combine to create a smooth, rich and creamy mouthfeel. Citra and Galaxy hops for flavour and aroma — you get a face full of fruit salad. We are pretty sure this will count towards your “5 a day”. (Or not...)",
