Thanks to some lingering sweet toffee and caramel flavours, the Real Ale packs loads of flavour into a 4% beer. So much so that we were invited to the UK for the 2014 International Real Ale Festival and were incredibly honoured to see this beer pick up the Gold medal, matching it with some big hitters from the home of Best Bitters. To get the most from the Real Ale, we recommend serving it between 6-8°C.\r\n\r\nMalt: Marris Otter, Ale, Caramunich, Medium Crystal \r\n\r\nHops: Galaxy, Ella, Topaz ","beer_style":"Bitter - Best","has_had":false,"beer_active":1},"brewery":{"brewery_id":28042,"brewery_name":"Young Henrys","brewery_slug":"young-henrys","brewery_page_url":"\/YoungHenrys","brewery_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/brewery_logos\/brewery-28042_5e16b.jpeg","country_name":"Australia","contact":{"twitter":"younghenrys","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/younghenrysbrewing","url":"https:\/\/younghenrys.com"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Newtown","brewery_state":"New South Wales","lat":-33.8978,"lng":151.178},"brewery_active":1},"venue":{"venue_id":941644,"venue_name":"The Henson","venue_slug":"the-henson","primary_category_key":"Dining and Drinking","primary_category":"Dining and Drinking","parent_category_id":"63be6904847c3692a84b9bb5","categories":{"count":1,"items":[{"category_key":"pub","category_name":"Pub","category_id":"4bf58dd8d48988d11b941735","is_primary":true}]},"location":{"venue_address":"91 Illawarra Rd","venue_city":"Marrickville","venue_state":"NSW","venue_country":"Australia","lat":-33.9053192,"lng":151.1614227},"contact":{"twitter":"","venue_url":"http:\/\/www.thehenson.com.au"},"foursquare":{"foursquare_id":"51ea6a435019f55eb83ab339","foursquare_url":"http:\/\/4sq.com\/12V8mH6"},"venue_icon":{"sm":"https:\/\/ss3.4sqi.net\/img\/categories_v2\/nightlife\/pub_bg_64.png","md":"https:\/\/ss3.4sqi.net\/img\/categories_v2\/nightlife\/pub_bg_88.png","lg":"https:\/\/ss3.4sqi.net\/img\/categories_v2\/nightlife\/pub_bg_512.png"},"is_verified":false,"spotlights":[],"has_beer":false,"has_food":false,"has_wine":false,"has_spirits":false},"comments":{"total_count":0,"count":0,"items":[]},"toasts":{"total_count":0,"count":0,"auth_toast":false,"items":[]},"media":{"count":0,"items":[]},"source":{"app_name":"Untappd for Android - (V4)","app_website":"http:\/\/untpd.it\/androidapp"},"badges":{"count":0,"items":[]}}],"pagination":{"since_url":"https:\/\/api.untappd.com\/v4\/beer\/checkins\/157257?max_id=1395173762","next_url":"https:\/\/api.untappd.com\/v4\/beer\/checkins\/157257?max_id=1395173762","max_id":1395173762}},"similar":{"method":"out_of_production","count":0,"items":[]},"friends":{"items":[],"count":0},"weighted_rating_score":3.48424,"beer_active":1,"vintages":{"count":0,"items":[]},"brewed_by":{"count":0,"items":[]}}}}
