Smooth velvety mouthfeel, layers of rich espresso, chocolate with a refreshing coffee bitterness for balance.","beer_style":"Stout - Coffee","has_had":false,"beer_active":1},"brewery":{"brewery_id":396285,"brewery_name":"Canyon Brewing","brewery_slug":"canyon-brewing","brewery_page_url":"\/CanyonBrewCo","brewery_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/brewery_logos\/brewery-396285_abb23.jpeg","country_name":"New Zealand","contact":{"twitter":"","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/CanyonBrewingQT","url":"https:\/\/www.canyonfoodandbrew.co.nz\/"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Arthurs Point","brewery_state":"Otago","lat":-44.9876,"lng":168.672},"brewery_active":1},"venue":{"venue_id":7849125,"venue_name":"Canyon Food & Brew Co.","venue_slug":"canyon-food-brew-co","primary_category_key":"Dining and Drinking","primary_category":"Dining and Drinking","parent_category_id":"63be6904847c3692a84b9bb5","categories":{"count":1,"items":[{"category_key":"brewery","category_name":"Brewery","category_id":"50327c8591d4c4b30a586d5d","is_primary":true}]},"location":{"venue_address":"1 Arthurs Point Road, Arthurs Point","venue_city":"Queenstown","venue_state":"Otago","venue_country":"New Zealand","lat":-44.9875221,"lng":168.6721649},"contact":{"twitter":"","venue_url":"https:\/\/www.canyonfoodandbrew.co.nz"},"foursquare":{"foursquare_id":"5b2b22871ffe97002c160b53","foursquare_url":"https:\/\/4sq.com\/2I8uKJh"},"venue_icon":{"sm":"https:\/\/ss3.4sqi.net\/img\/categories_v2\/food\/brewery_bg_64.png","md":"https:\/\/ss3.4sqi.net\/img\/categories_v2\/food\/brewery_bg_88.png","lg":"https:\/\/ss3.4sqi.net\/img\/categories_v2\/food\/brewery_bg_512.png"},"is_verified":false,"spotlights":[],"has_beer":false,"has_food":false,"has_wine":false,"has_spirits":false},"comments":{"total_count":0,"count":0,"items":[]},"toasts":{"total_count":0,"count":0,"auth_toast":false,"items":[]},"media":{"count":1,"items":[{"photo_id":562519100,"photo":{"photo_img_sm":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=200&height=200&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2024_09_20\/25c615c0bbf492eef99e97e5ec3aed35_c_1418722843_raw.jpg","photo_img_md":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=640&height=640&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2024_09_20\/25c615c0bbf492eef99e97e5ec3aed35_c_1418722843_raw.jpg","photo_img_lg":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=1280&height=1280&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2024_09_20\/25c615c0bbf492eef99e97e5ec3aed35_c_1418722843_raw.jpg","photo_img_og":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/photos\/2024_09_20\/25c615c0bbf492eef99e97e5ec3aed35_c_1418722843_raw.jpg"}}]},"source":{"app_name":"Untappd for iPhone - (V2)","app_website":"http:\/\/untpd.it\/iphoneapp"},"badges":{"retro_status":false,"count":2,"items":[{"badge_id":386389,"user_badge_id":1240033685,"badge_name":"Wake Up and Smell The Coffee!
