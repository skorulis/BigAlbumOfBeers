The deep amber color, thick creamy head, and rich flavor all testify to our traditional brewing methods. Anchor Steam is unique, for our brewing process has evolved over many decades and is like no other in the world. Anchor Steam derives its unusual name from the 19th century when \"steam\" seems to have been a nickname for beer brewed on the West Coast of America under primitive conditions and without ice. The brewing methods of those days are a mystery and, although there are many theories, no one can say with certainty why the word \"steam\" came to be associated with beer. For many decades Anchor alone has used this quaint name for its unique beer. In modern times, \"Steam\" has become a trademark of Anchor Brewing.","beer_style":"California Common","has_had":false,"beer_active":1},"brewery":{"brewery_id":3891,"brewery_name":"Anchor Brewing Company","brewery_slug":"anchor-brewing-company","brewery_page_url":"\/anchorbrewing","brewery_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/brewery_logos\/brewery-3891_f16ad.jpeg","country_name":"United States","contact":{"twitter":"AnchorBrewing","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/anchorbrewing","url":"https:\/\/raiseanchor.anchorbrewing.com"},"location":{"brewery_city":"San Francisco","brewery_state":"CA","lat":37.7784,"lng":-122.388},"brewery_active":1},"venue":{"venue_id":9917985,"venue_name":"Untappd at Home","venue_slug":"at-home","primary_category_key":null,"primary_category":null,"parent_category_id":"4e67e38e036454776db1fb3a","categories":{"count":1,"items":[{"category_key":"home_private","category_name":"Home (private)","category_id":"4bf58dd8d48988d103941735","is_primary":true}]},"location":{"venue_address":"","venue_city":"","venue_state":"NC","venue_country":"United States","lat":34.2346611,"lng":-77.9482117},"contact":{"twitter":"","venue_url":""},"foursquare":{"foursquare_id":"5e7b4d99c91df60008e8b168","foursquare_url":"https:\/\/4sq.com\/3bDWYuq"},"venue_icon":{"sm":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/venuelogos\/venue_9917985_b3a5d245_bg_64.png","md":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/venuelogos\/venue_9917985_b3a5d245_bg_88.png","lg":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/venuelogos\/venue_9917985_b3a5d245_bg_176.png?v=1"},"is_verified":true,"spotlights":[],"has_beer":false,"has_food":false,"has_wine":false,"has_spirits":false},"comments":{"total_count":1,"count":1,"items":[{"user":{"uid":9258971,"user_name":"PilsWil","first_name":"Willemijn","last_name":"Pauwels","bio":"","location":"","relationship":"none","is_supporter":0,"user_avatar":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/profile\/17c5fbe1d8299723555d7c012cbae4c2_100x100.jpg","account_type":"user","venue_details":[],"brewery_details":[]},"checkin_id":1444249961,"comment_id":84038778,"comment_owner":false,"comment_editor":false,"comment":"Goor","created_at":"Wed, 25 Dec 2024 16:15:33 +0000","comment_source":"API"}]},"toasts":{"total_count":2,"count":2,"auth_toast":null,"items":[{"uid":8484209,"user":{"uid":8484209,"user_name":"danny_pauwels_1680","first_name":"Danny","last_name":"Pauwels","bio":"","location":"","relationship":"none","user_avatar":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/profile\/d7159e089cd0568c1570cacc0027849c-fb_100x100.jpg","account_type":"user","venue_details":[],"brewery_details":[]},"like_id":1599618201,"like_owner":false,"created_at":"Thu, 26 Dec 2024 18:51:08 +0000"},{"uid":9258971,"user":{"uid":9258971,"user_name":"PilsWil","first_name":"Willemijn","last_name":"Pauwels","bio":"","location":"","relationship":"none","user_avatar":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/profile\/17c5fbe1d8299723555d7c012cbae4c2_100x100.jpg","account_type":"user","venue_details":[],"brewery_details":[]},"like_id":1598921638,"like_owner":false,"created_at":"Wed, 25 Dec 2024 16:15:29 +0000"}]},"media":{"count":1,"items":[{"photo_id":576432191,"photo":{"photo_img_sm":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=200&height=200&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2024_12_24\/8937225c8ba320857545e4f2946d82a7_c_1444249961_raw.jpg","photo_img_md":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=640&height=640&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2024_12_24\/8937225c8ba320857545e4f2946d82a7_c_1444249961_raw.jpg","photo_img_lg":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=1280&height=1280&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2024_12_24\/8937225c8ba320857545e4f2946d82a7_c_1444249961_raw.jpg","photo_img_og":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/photos\/2024_12_24\/8937225c8ba320857545e4f2946d82a7_c_1444249961_raw.jpg"}}]},"source":{"app_name":"Untappd for iPhone - (V2)","app_website":"http:\/\/untpd.it\/iphoneapp"},"badges":{"retro_status":false,"count":3,"items":[{"badge_id":90681,"user_badge_id":1264968881,"badge_name":"Verified Adventure (Level 96)","badge_description":"While spontaneity can be fun, sometimes you want to make sure your adventure will rock.
