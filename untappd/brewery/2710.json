And, as the sun begins to sink into the sea, the only thing that could make life any better would be a glass of cool, hop-laden pale ale. This is the feeling and the moment that Lushingtons was brewed for.","is_in_production":1,"created_at":"Sun, 28 Apr 2013 15:53:02 +0000","user_rating_score":0,"rating_score":3.455,"rating_count":9181,"has_had":null,"on_list":false,"auth_rating":0,"wish_list":false},"brewery":{"brewery_id":2710,"brewery_name":"Skinner's Brewery","brewery_slug":"skinner-s-brewery","brewery_page_url":"\/SkinnersBrewingCo","brewery_type":"Regional Brewery","brewery_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/brewery_logos\/brewery-2710_56e95.jpeg","country_name":"England","contact":{"twitter":"Skinnersbrewery","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Skinners-Brewery\/209864665734322","instagram":"skinnersbrewery","url":"http:\/\/www.skinnersbrewery.com\/"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Truro","brewery_state":"Cornwall","lat":50.2546005,"lng":-5.04461},"brewery_active":1},"friends":{"items":[],"count":0}},{"total_user_count":0,"has_had":null,"total_count":9055,"beer":{"bid":9677,"beer_name":"Cornish Knocker","beer_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/beer_logos\/beer-9677_91f60_sm.jpeg","beer_style":"Blonde \/ Golden Ale - English","beer_abv":4.5,"beer_ibu":0,"beer_slug":"skinner-s-brewery-cornish-knocker","beer_description":"Ground-Breaking Golden Ale.

A great session lager, and a perfect partner for spicy food and gourmet burgers. This unique lager honours Cornwall’s coastal “towans”, or sand dunes. The Atlantic winds and tides that shaped these rugged hills also inspired our brewers as they crafted Towans’ powerful taste, refreshing aromas and foamy white head. Like Cornwall and its people, it is born of the sea and the maritime climate, and evokes the tastes, sights and mood of the region.","is_in_production":1,"created_at":"Fri, 07 Jun 2019 15:54:35 +0000","user_rating_score":0,"rating_score":3.415,"rating_count":184,"has_had":null,"on_list":false,"auth_rating":0,"wish_list":false},"brewery":{"brewery_id":2710,"brewery_name":"Skinner's Brewery","brewery_slug":"skinner-s-brewery","brewery_page_url":"\/SkinnersBrewingCo","brewery_type":"Regional Brewery","brewery_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/brewery_logos\/brewery-2710_56e95.jpeg","country_name":"England","contact":{"twitter":"Skinnersbrewery","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Skinners-Brewery\/209864665734322","instagram":"skinnersbrewery","url":"http:\/\/www.skinnersbrewery.com\/"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Truro","brewery_state":"Cornwall","lat":50.2546005,"lng":-5.04461},"brewery_active":1},"friends":{"items":[],"count":0}},{"total_user_count":0,"has_had":null,"total_count":208,"beer":{"bid":2723938,"beer_name":"Hazy Mango Pale","beer_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/beer_logos\/beer-2723938_30331_sm.jpeg","beer_style":"Pale Ale - New England \/ Hazy","beer_abv":6,"beer_ibu":0,"beer_slug":"skinner-s-brewery-hazy-mango-pale","beer_description":"The second release in our limited edition Aleblazer series, Hazy Mango pairs the soft biscuit flavours of the Cornish malts perfectly with the smooth tropical flavours of Citra, Azacca and Idaho-7.
