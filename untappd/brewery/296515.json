      "brewery_description": "A treacherous cove at Cape Conran is the inspiration for the name and the spirit of Sailor’s Grave, brews inspired by the ocean and rural living. A sea change and love for beer prompted Chris & Gab Moore to assemble East Gippsland’s newest brewery in the abandend 1893 Orbost Butter and Produce factory – not far from where Gabs grew up. The pair live with their two children on a family farm at Point Ricardo on the coast, and source buckets of inspiration from their surroundings. Their beers are shaped by the ever-present coastal elements that dominate life here and rooted in the farms and plains where the Snowy River meets the sea. Sailor’s Grave will make the most of the bountiful land around where they live and work, by incorporating indignous botanicals picked in the bush, salt, weed and sea life harvested from from river and ocean, fruits, grains & produce from local farms & orchards and wild yeasts from thair backyard. Chris and Gab plan to keep the beers approachable even when they get adventurous. The pair have big plans for an array of limited edition seasonally inspiresd beers. Beers from the deep sou'east",
