It also represents head brewer Kirk and his other half Dragana who set out on a wild adventure to turn a lifelong passion of creating great craft beer into a reality.\r\n\r\nHead brewer Kirk has been home brewing for over 30 years. With all this experience, you can expect nothing but amazing brews, many of which have been inspired by Central European Ales and Lagers along with new world beers. With our taphouse opening up soon, we look forward to sharing some incredible, locally crafted beers with you.",
