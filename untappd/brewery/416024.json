      "brewery_description": "We are an independent Australian craft brewery that prides itself on quality, creativity, authenticity and community, stemming from the old adage of a good beer shared with good mates.\r\nSea Legs Brewing Co is a 15-hectolitre brewery with 15,000 litre fermenting capacity where we not only brew and ensure consistency with our mainstay and much-loved Core Range but also our signature Limited Releases.\r\nOur Limited Releases provide an opportunity for the brewers to challenge the status quo and colour outside the lines, with these creative concoctions released regularly. Whether it’s hop driven charm or malty magic, you’ll find something that ‘tipples’ your fancy. An additional 100 litre fermenter is used for our specialty, seasonal and experimental batch brews for keg only releases. \r\n\r\nLocated under the iconic Story Bridge in Kangaroo Point, you'll always find a fresh line up of brews along with an epic food menu too. There's no better way to compliment a fresh, ice-cold beer than with a rustic pizza, tasty burger, pile of chicken wings or cheeseburger spring rolls. Our American inspired style menu is perfect for sharing, and there's even a kid's menu for the little ones.\r\n\r\nNot near our venue? You can order online, or checkout Sea Legs stockists on our website to see where you can find yours!",
