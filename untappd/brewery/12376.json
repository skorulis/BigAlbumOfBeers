For 17 years we have been brewing fresh quality beer using New Zealand grown hops and malted barley.\r\n\r\nIndependence means thinking for ourselves. We have an ethos of resourcefulness and creativity in how our brewery is run. We are proud to be New Zealandâ€™s first B Corp certified Brewery.\r\n\r\nWe want our beer to taste clean and to honour the ingredients. We are in to making styles that have been around for a long time and seeing how they turn out in our hands, and in our brewery. These beers have a heritage and yet making them up north will always give them an edge.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate our place. This raw landscape has a bearing on everything we do and people here are resourceful, creative and hardworking.",
