We thought it was high time someone tried doing something cold, tasty and delicious. \r\n\r\nCanyon is an award-winning craft brewery in Arthur's Point, Queenstown. We love fresh ingredients with no artificial nasties and the purest mountain water right out the front door. \r\n\r\nFall off a bridge, raft unchartered waters, flip into some backcountry powder pits and pour a tasty Canyon brew.\r\n\r\nHere's to the bold, the brave, and the plain old stupid. \r\n\r\n\r\nCanyon Brewery, Beer for the bold.",
