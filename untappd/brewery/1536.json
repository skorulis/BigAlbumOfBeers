Brewed to celebrate the life of our co-founder James Minkin who sadly passed away in summer 2020. Showcasing the very best in British and local ingredients, JIMBO is a classic British Best Bitter that has a recognisable Purity character and balance of flavour.\r\n\r\nUsing only finest hops from our long-standing friends at Charles Faram. JIMBO is brewed with Pilgrim for that initial bitterness alongside the classics Fuggles, Goldings and a brand-new hop Emperor – part of the Charles Faram hop breeding programme. The combination of classic and new wave hops give JIMBO aromas of mixed berries, crisp apple, yet all balanced with a well-rounded nutty bitter finish. JIMBO is also vegan and gluten-free.\r\n\r\nAs part of Purity’s commitment to the local community and a further way of continuing Jim’s legacy the brewery is donating 5p for every can sold to the Pancreatic Cancer Research Fund (PCRF).","beer_style":"Bitter - Session \/ Ordinary","has_had":false,"beer_active":1},"brewery":{"brewery_id":1536,"brewery_name":"Purity Brewing Co.","brewery_slug":"purity-brewing-co","brewery_page_url":"\/puritybrewingco","brewery_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/brewery_logos\/brewery-1536_1e439.jpeg","country_name":"England","contact":{"twitter":"PurityBrewingCo","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/puritybrewingco","url":"https:\/\/puritybrewing.com"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Alcester","brewery_state":"Warwickshire","lat":52.256,"lng":-1.85035},"brewery_active":1},"venue":{"venue_id":122828,"venue_name":"The Wellington","venue_slug":"the-wellington","primary_category_key":"Dining and Drinking","primary_category":"Dining and Drinking","parent_category_id":"63be6904847c3692a84b9bb5","categories":{"count":1,"items":[{"category_key":"pub","category_name":"Pub","category_id":"4bf58dd8d48988d11b941735","is_primary":true}]},"location":{"venue_address":"Wellington street","venue_city":"Bedford","venue_state":"","venue_country":"United Kingdom","lat":52.1412086,"lng":-0.4684917},"contact":{"twitter":"","venue_url":"http:\/\/homepage.ntlworld.com\/eric.mills1"},"foursquare":{"foursquare_id":"4c05545df56c2d7f3d7e1f66","foursquare_url":"http:\/\/4sq.com\/dlbQOD"},"venue_icon":{"sm":"https:\/\/ss3.4sqi.net\/img\/categories_v2\/nightlife\/pub_bg_64.png","md":"https:\/\/ss3.4sqi.net\/img\/categories_v2\/nightlife\/pub_bg_88.png","lg":"https:\/\/ss3.4sqi.net\/img\/categories_v2\/nightlife\/pub_bg_512.png"},"is_verified":false,"spotlights":[],"has_beer":false,"has_food":false,"has_wine":false,"has_spirits":false},"comments":{"total_count":0,"count":0,"items":[]},"toasts":{"total_count":0,"count":0,"auth_toast":false,"items":[]},"media":{"count":0,"items":[]},"source":{"app_name":"Untappd for Android - (V4)","app_website":"http:\/\/untpd.it\/androidapp"},"badges":{"retro_status":false,"count":3,"items":[{"badge_id":5969,"user_badge_id":1266467496,"badge_name":"Riding Steady (Level 7)","badge_description":"Want to enjoy a day of brews, but need to keep your wits sharp?

Showcasing the very best in British and local ingredients, JIMBO is a classic British Best Bitter that has a recognisable Purity character and balance of flavour.\r\n\r\nUsing only finest hops from our long-standing friends at Charles Faram. JIMBO is brewed with Pilgrim for that initial bitterness alongside the classics Fuggles, Goldings and a brand-new hop Emperor – part of the Charles Faram hop breeding programme. The combination of classic and new wave hops give JIMBO aromas of mixed berries, crisp apple, yet all balanced with a well-rounded nutty bitter finish. JIMBO is also vegan and gluten-free.\r\n\r\nAs part of Purity’s commitment to the local community and a further way of continuing Jim’s legacy the brewery is donating 5p for every can sold to the Pancreatic Cancer Research Fund (PCRF).","is_in_production":1,"created_at":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 00:30:53 +0000","user_rating_score":0,"rating_score":3.524,"rating_count":2223,"has_had":null,"on_list":false,"auth_rating":0,"wish_list":false},"brewery":{"brewery_id":1536,"brewery_name":"Purity Brewing Co.","brewery_slug":"purity-brewing-co","brewery_page_url":"\/puritybrewingco","brewery_type":"Regional Brewery","brewery_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/brewery_logos\/brewery-1536_1e439.jpeg","country_name":"England","contact":{"twitter":"PurityBrewingCo","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/puritybrewingco","instagram":"puritybrewingco","url":"https:\/\/puritybrewing.com"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Alcester","brewery_state":"Warwickshire","lat":52.2560005,"lng":-1.85035},"brewery_active":1},"friends":{"items":[],"count":0}},{"total_user_count":0,"has_had":null,"total_count":1787,"beer":{"bid":5024268,"beer_name":"New England IPA","beer_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/beer_logos\/beer-5024268_becb3_sm.jpeg","beer_style":"IPA - New England \/ Hazy","beer_abv":5.8,"beer_ibu":0,"beer_slug":"purity-brewing-co-new-england-ipa","beer_description":"","is_in_production":1,"created_at":"Sat, 17 Sep 2022 06:14:05 +0000","user_rating_score":0,"rating_score":3.741,"rating_count":1444,"has_had":null,"on_list":false,"auth_rating":0,"wish_list":false},"brewery":{"brewery_id":1536,"brewery_name":"Purity Brewing Co.","brewery_slug":"purity-brewing-co","brewery_page_url":"\/puritybrewingco","brewery_type":"Regional Brewery","brewery_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/brewery_logos\/brewery-1536_1e439.jpeg","country_name":"England","contact":{"twitter":"PurityBrewingCo","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/puritybrewingco","instagram":"puritybrewingco","url":"https:\/\/puritybrewing.com"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Alcester","brewery_state":"Warwickshire","lat":52.2560005,"lng":-1.85035},"brewery_active":1},"friends":{"items":[],"count":0}},{"total_user_count":0,"has_had":null,"total_count":1339,"beer":{"bid":3387913,"beer_name":"Purity Pale (Official Ale of Aston Villa FC)","beer_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/beer_logos\/beer-3387913_ceb9c_sm.jpeg","beer_style":"Pale Ale - English","beer_abv":4.2,"beer_ibu":0,"beer_slug":"purity-brewing-co-purity-pale-official-ale-of-aston-villa-fc","beer_description":"Created exclusively for Villa Park.
