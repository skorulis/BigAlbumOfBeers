      "brewery_description": "Henry Pike left Dorset, England in 1878 and sailed into Port Adelaide aboard the HMS Oaklands. In 1886 he founded Pikes Oakbank Brewery, producing a range of fine ales, stout and tonic water. In 1996, Pikes Oakbank beer was re-introduced by the fifth generation descendants of Henry Pike, brothers Andrew and Neil Pike of Pikes Wines in the Clare Valley of South Australia.\nSince the time when Pikes Beer was relaunched, it has gone through a long process of brewing and labeling evolution to the point where we have now returned the label to its roots, by imitating an early label from the original Oakbank Brewery. The current range includes the Pilsener Lager, the Genuine Stout, and our Sparkling Ale.\n\n***NEWS***\nAfter almost 20 years of contract brewing, we are finally bringing the whole operation back to Clare, South Australia. We will be up and brewing in December 2014, so keep your eyes and ears peeled for news and information on the new brewery!",
