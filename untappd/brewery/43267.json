      "brewery_description": "We've been into making (and drinking) beer for a long time - we're kind of nerdy scientists about it actually. In late 2013 we decided to start making beer professionally and released a Double IPA that was a little bit hoppy and got some attention. We're only as successful as the support we receive, so thank you!\n\nThere's three of us - Nat, Callum and Clara. We are all giant nerds and look after different aspects of our craft.\n\nWe do everything by hand. Sometimes this is painful because we're perfectionists and our methods aren't commercial, but we love it and there's no other way to get the flavours we want.\n\nWe also make the delicious Golden Axe apple cider!",
