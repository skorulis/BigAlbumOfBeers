      "brewery_description": "An avid home brewer since 2005, Adam Betts established Edge Brewing Project, winning Best Brewer in Australia, plus Best Pale Lager in the world, on ratebeer.com within the first 2 years. \r\n\r\nEdge is a gypsy brewery, meaning the beer is brewed at multiple facilities, renting equipment at existing top breweries rather than having one production site. A great excuse to travel and brew. \r\n\r\nEdge brews innovative, new world style craft beer, placing a strong focus on native ingredients. All brews are unfiltered and unpasteurised with no additives or extracts. The beers are designed for optimum fresh taste with perfect balance and drinkability.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe concept of each beer is initially experimented on using Edge's custom built 50L pilot brewery in Fitzroy North, Australia. Once perfected, they are upscaled to commercial batches, utilising selected Microbreweries.\r\n\r\nNot tied down with a physical brewery, allows the flexibility to brew beers where and when desired, having an array of equipment to use, access to locally sourced ingredients, and an opportunity to collaborate and grow with fellow brewers.
