Brewers still use them, but just for bittering. That’s it. And when harvest comes around every year, there are no fresh hop beers, because they would all just taste like dirt and earth and grass. BUT, in their place, pumpkin beers fill the craft beer landscape - flooding the Fall market with vegetable beers. Every warm shelf and tap is taken over by jack-o-lantern themed beers with names like “YUM YUM PUMPKIN!” and “DREAMY HALLOWEENY” and “PUMP FLUFF MUFFIN” that make you want to stab your jugular with a pumpkin carving knife. And, every single offering has that blend of familiar spices, but at least they vary in color and base style. Some breweries are so prolific in their pumpkin brewing prowess that they not only attract attention from every beer nerd, but also Big Beer. AB-Inbev sees this growing market and wants -NEEDS- to be a player in it, so they start buying up independent breweries, one by one, slowly at first, then at rampant pace, until they confuse the consumer with so many options nobody knows who owns what anymore, creating customer indifference in ownership and operations and origins among the sea of SKUs, where only the deepest of pockets prevail, squeezing out small, independent, locally-owned and operated breweries until there are few left.  In this Cantwellian Dystopia, THIS beer would be KING - a milk chocolatey base beer brewed with Libby’s canned pumpkin and spiced with a blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, allspice and clove. OK WAKE UP!

Brewers still use them, but just for bittering. That’s it. And when harvest comes around every year, there are no fresh hop beers, because they would all just taste like dirt and earth and grass. BUT, in their place, pumpkin beers fill the craft beer landscape - flooding the Fall market with vegetable beers. Every warm shelf and tap is taken over by jack-o-lantern themed beers with names like “YUM YUM PUMPKIN!” and “DREAMY HALLOWEENY” and “PUMP FLUFF MUFFIN” that make you want to stab your jugular with a pumpkin carving knife. And, every single offering has that blend of familiar spices, but at least they vary in color and base style. Some breweries are so prolific in their pumpkin brewing prowess that they not only attract attention from every beer nerd, but also Big Beer. AB-Inbev sees this growing market and wants -NEEDS- to be a player in it, so they start buying up independent breweries, one by one, slowly at first, then at rampant pace, until they confuse the consumer with so many options nobody knows who owns what anymore, creating customer indifference in ownership and operations and origins among the sea of SKUs, where only the deepest of pockets prevail, squeezing out small, independent, locally-owned and operated breweries until there are few left.  In this Cantwellian Dystopia, THIS beer would be KING - a milk chocolatey base beer brewed with Libby’s canned pumpkin and spiced with a blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, allspice and clove. OK WAKE UP! It was all a dream...WAIT BUT...\r\n","beer_style":"Pumpkin \/ Yam Beer","has_had":false,"beer_active":1},"brewery":{"brewery_id":237980,"brewery_name":"Cloudburst Brewing","brewery_slug":"cloudburst-brewing","brewery_page_url":"\/CloudburstBrewing","brewery_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/brewery_logos\/brewery-237980_eace7.jpeg","country_name":"United States","contact":{"twitter":"Cloudburst_Brew","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/cloudburstbrewing","url":"http:\/\/www.cloudburstbrew.com\/"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Seattle","brewery_state":"WA","lat":47.6117,"lng":-122.345},"brewery_active":1},"venue":{"venue_id":130572,"venue_name":"Walt's Pourhouse","venue_slug":"walts-pourhouse","primary_category_en":null,"primary_category":null,"parent_category_id":"4d4b7105d754a06376d81259","categories":{"count":1,"items":[{"category_key":"bar","category_name_en":"Bar","category_name":"Bar","category_id":"4bf58dd8d48988d116941735","is_primary":true}]},"location":{"venue_address":"1880 North 7th Street","venue_city":"Coos Bay","venue_state":"OR","venue_country":"United States","lat":43.381321,"lng":-124.221138},"contact":{"twitter":"","venue_url":"https:\/\/www.waltspourhouse.com\/"},"foursquare":{"foursquare_id":"4be753844485d13a08ec93ee","foursquare_url":"http:\/\/4sq.com\/9Ioz32"},"venue_icon":{"sm":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/venuelogos\/venue_130572_a6ecb147_bg_64.png","md":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/venuelogos\/venue_130572_a6ecb147_bg_88.png","lg":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/venuelogos\/venue_130572_a6ecb147_bg_176.png?v=1"},"is_verified":true,"spotlights":[],"has_beer":true,"has_food":false,"has_wine":false,"has_spirits":false},"comments":{"total_count":0,"count":0,"items":[]},"toasts":{"total_count":0,"count":0,"auth_toast":false,"items":[]},"media":{"count":1,"items":[{"photo_id":616283551,"photo":{"photo_img_sm":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=200&height=200&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2025_09_26\/5fbfc21a6d67ba6c5a841c99ebd59675_c_1516243748_raw.jpg","photo_img_md":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=640&height=640&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2025_09_26\/5fbfc21a6d67ba6c5a841c99ebd59675_c_1516243748_raw.jpg","photo_img_lg":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=1280&height=1280&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2025_09_26\/5fbfc21a6d67ba6c5a841c99ebd59675_c_1516243748_raw.jpg","photo_img_og":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/photos\/2025_09_26\/5fbfc21a6d67ba6c5a841c99ebd59675_c_1516243748_raw.jpg"}}]},"source":{"app_name":"Untappd for Android - (V4)","app_website":"http:\/\/untpd.it\/androidapp"},"badges":{"retro_status":false,"count":1,"items":[{"badge_id":243512,"user_badge_id":1335423907,"badge_name":"Brewery Pioneer (Level 17)","badge_description":"There's beer in them thar hills!

Brewers still use them, but just for bittering. That’s it. And when harvest comes around every year, there are no fresh hop beers, because they would all just taste like dirt and earth and grass. BUT, in their place, pumpkin beers fill the craft beer landscape - flooding the Fall market with vegetable beers. Every warm shelf and tap is taken over by jack-o-lantern themed beers with names like “YUM YUM PUMPKIN!” and “DREAMY HALLOWEENY” and “PUMP FLUFF MUFFIN” that make you want to stab your jugular with a pumpkin carving knife. And, every single offering has that blend of familiar spices, but at least they vary in color and base style. Some breweries are so prolific in their pumpkin brewing prowess that they not only attract attention from every beer nerd, but also Big Beer. AB-Inbev sees this growing market and wants -NEEDS- to be a player in it, so they start buying up independent breweries, one by one, slowly at first, then at rampant pace, until they confuse the consumer with so many options nobody knows who owns what anymore, creating customer indifference in ownership and operations and origins among the sea of SKUs, where only the deepest of pockets prevail, squeezing out small, independent, locally-owned and operated breweries until there are few left.  In this Cantwellian Dystopia, THIS beer would be KING - a milk chocolatey base beer brewed with Libby’s canned pumpkin and spiced with a blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, allspice and clove.

Then, we’re gonna mix it up, collect some wort and dump the rest out, by spilling as little of the mash on the floor as possible. Nelson Sauvin, your job is to get added to the kettle over here. Citra and Mosaic, you’ll be over here and be added to the kettle as well. Once you're done in the kettle, all three of you need to run over to the fermenter and get in as quickly as possible. Careful, the yeast is tricky over there - you’re going to have navigate it to not get muddled in the process. After that, you’ll need to save some flavors and aroma for the final dry-hop.
