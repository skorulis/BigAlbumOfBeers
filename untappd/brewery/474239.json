      "brewery_description": "Atomic Beer Project is proud to call Redfern home. \r\nIt’s where we brew and enjoy a beer. It’s where we get together for a bite to eat. And it’s where we have a good time.\r\n\r\nWith our micro-brewery and tanks on site, you’ll see the brewing first-hand. We’re passionate brewers, and love exploring flavour through hoppy beers. Alongside our core-range, you’ll find a rotation of limited release and seasonal beers. We’re all about trying new things, so you’ll always find something to discover, as well as your Atomic Beer Project favourites.\r\n\r\nGood beer is almost definitely better with good food. The Atomic menu is inspired by Pan-Asian cuisine that just happens to sit nicely alongside a cold beer - with bites and share plates for lunch and dinner. Think a trip around South East Asia and Japan, where all your favourite dishes make up the itinerary.\r\n\r\nAnd if you need a place to call office for the day, we do that too. Our co-working space has free and fast wi-fi, and all the power outlets and cables you’ll need. Who doesn’t want to work from a brewery, right?\r\n\r\nIt all started more than a decade ago with a single beer, our original pale ale. And now it’s so much more. We can’t wait to see you at our place for a beer, bite and bit of fun.\r\n\r\nAtomic Beer Project | 158 Regent Street Redfern\r\n\r\nOpen for Lunch & dinner | 10am to late",
