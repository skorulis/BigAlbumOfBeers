      "brewery_description": "Cupitt Craft Brewers are a  NSW South Coast Brewery.   Family owned, we take pride in producing outstanding beer in a beautiful part of the world.   We have a deep respect for the immense history and strong traditions of brewing, but don’t let that get in the way of exploring new styles and flavours. The character is paramount, as is balance, and we revel in perfecting classic styles as much as we have fun pushing the boundaries of beer.\r\n\r\nOur brewery was established in 2014 after Wally and Tom Cupitt had dreamed for many years about opening one alongside the existing winery and restaurant.   Before Wally started making wine, he was a fanatic home brewer and honed his brewing skills with a work experience stint at a small brewery in Manly. Tom’s passion for craft beer stems from his time living in London, where he fell in love with traditional ales and lively beer culture. Together with Head Brewer Liam Jackson, they continue to make beer that they enjoy drinking.  \r\n\r\nAll our beer is produced on the Cupitt family property and is sold almost exclusively here at our restaurant and casual bar. We hope you visit and enjoy the brews as much as the views.",
