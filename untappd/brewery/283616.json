      "brewery_description": "We're all about making refreshing beers with a hit of beastly flavour that not only taste good, but do some good too.\n\nThis all started with a few beer loving boys and a conversation that turned into a philosophy that morphed into a hastily put together business plan in 2015.\n\nThe basis of the conversation - \"Imagine if every beer we ever had did a little good in the world\"\n\nInspired by a mate suffering from - and raising funds for - Motor Neurone Disease (MND/ALS), we decided we should combine our love of beer with our philanthropic ideals, and support him in his quest to help find a cure for 'The Beast' of a disease that is MND. \n\nHaving released 3 brews, and raised over $100,000 in our first year, we're off to a great start, so with your support we hope to keep pouring out the goodness for years to come.  \n\nGood beer. Good deeds. Good times!",
