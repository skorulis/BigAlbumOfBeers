The original Hahn Brewers took a risk to brew a better beer for the greater good of Australia and hands up, we haven’t got it right every time. But we never settled and every mistake we’ve made has fuelled our passion to innovate more and make our beers the best they can be. That spirit of risk-taking is still alive and kicking today – we push the boundaries in everything we do and brew.\n\nOf course, pushing the boundaries isn’t the only thing that gives our beers that unmistakable crisp, dry taste. That also comes from using the latest brewing technology, top grade ingredients and a shedload of patience.\n\nInnovation doesn’t happen when you use old-school tools. It happens when you use the best of modern brewing technology to push the limits of possibility.\n\nThe Hahn Brewers don’t skimp on ingredients. We take our time (and a lot of it) to find the finest barley and hops known to mankind. Is that an overstatement? Nope, we stick by it.\n\nThe secret sauce in Hahn’s distinct taste isn’t an ingredient at all. It’s an extremely long brewing process. By brewing our beer for longer, we convert more of the natural sugars, resulting in a crisp, dry and delicious beer. It also makes our beer low in carbohydrates, without compromising on flavour. It’s something we like to call The Happy Accident.\n\nThe Hahn brewing philosophy is having the passion and courage to make great things happen and never settling even when they do.","stats":{"total_count":30567,"unique_count":14645,"monthly_count":278,"weekly_count":88,"user_count":0,"age_on_service":5166.57613425926},"owners":{"count":1,"items":[{"brewery_id":137923,"is_brewery_group":0,"brewery_name":"Lion"}]},"media":{"count":15,"items":[{"photo_id":577280135,"photo":{"photo_img_sm":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=200&height=200&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2024_12_28\/12f48016a9ec4139a19eb0c671641de6_c_1445742180_raw.jpg","photo_img_md":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=640&height=640&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2024_12_28\/12f48016a9ec4139a19eb0c671641de6_c_1445742180_raw.jpg","photo_img_lg":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=1280&height=1280&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2024_12_28\/12f48016a9ec4139a19eb0c671641de6_c_1445742180_raw.jpg","photo_img_og":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/photos\/2024_12_28\/12f48016a9ec4139a19eb0c671641de6_c_1445742180_raw.jpg"},"created_at":"Sat,

And that’s exactly what the Hahn Brewers have done from the start. We’ve hit a few hurdles along the way but our passion for better brewing never fails us and sometimes we really hit the spot. Take Hahn Radler, a mid-strength lager cut with natural lemon for an extra-refreshing twist. It’s a surprisingly good blend and the ultimate refreshment on a cracking day.\n\nHahn Radler is a mid-strength lager cut with natural lemon that offers an extra refreshing twist. It’s a surprisingly good blend that you can’t find anywhere else. And, before you say ‘Hold on, that’s just a shandy!’ here’s the backstory to this unique brew.\n\nRadler is a traditional Bavarian beer and the inspiration behind this refreshing brew. The story goes that a German tavern owner back in the day built a path to his pub for cyclists so they could refresh themselves after a ride. Rider. Radler.
