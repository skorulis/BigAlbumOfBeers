Once you’ve picked your brews of choice, take them home to enjoy in 375ml cans, or in our refillable Block ‘n Tackle 1.89 Litre Stainless Steel Mini-Keg.\r\nAs a working brewery, you’ll see the beer in production only metres away from where it’s served to your glass. Our brewer (Paul) is onsite more often than not and is always happy to have a chat about the beers and the brewing process.",
