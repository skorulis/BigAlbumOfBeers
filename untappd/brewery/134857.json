      "brewery_description": "Our two loves have come together to form BentSpoke Brewing Co, a microbrewery and taphouse driven by a desire to provide you with a world-class craft beer experience.\n\nOne of the biggest beer fonts in the country is hardly enough to contain the imagination of our brewer. Competition for one of our 18 taps is tight with cask conditioned real ales, lagers, seasonal one-off batches, barrel aged new world bent styles & hand crushed ciders all vying for a spot at the bar.\n\nOur 18 different varieties of beer and cider are all lovingly brewed on premises by one of Australia’s most awarded brewers. Some change with the seasons, some are one-offs, others will stay the course.\n\nWe want you to fall in love with our brews and maybe even take one home in a BentSpoke Traveller! The Traveller is a two-litre refillable, insulated and pressurised container that allows you to enjoy brewery-fresh tap beer wherever life may take you. Ditch the esky & ice, and keep your seriously good beer, seriously cold, at the hottest of BBQ’s.",
