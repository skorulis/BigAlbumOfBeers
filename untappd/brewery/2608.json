It’s a home to surfers and swimmers; seagulls and sharks; ships and sailors. It’s a place where you can relax, escape, explore, or seek out adventure. We saw a lot of ourselves in that little spot. That’s why named our brewery after it.\n\nWe set up shop in an old margarine factory just outside Freo over 10 years ago and we’ve been crafting beer there ever since. We make a range of ales and lagers inspired by our place here on the WA coast.",
