      "brewery_description": "Haandbryggeriet: Innovation and tradition haand in haand.\r\n\r\nHaandbryggeriet is a craft beer brewery situated at Havnegata in Drammen.\r\n\r\nThe brewery was founded in 2005 by four home brewers who wanted to make high quality beers. In 2016 two of the original founders retired, and the brewery is today owned by a constellation of the two remaining founders,  some employees at the brewery and three other Norwegian craft breweries\r\n\r\nHaandbryggeriet currently has 10 employees all participating in developing new ground breaking beers and recipes\r\nThe brewery has a wide selection ranging from classic and traditional beers to new and innovative brews and hybrid beer styles.  Sometimes brewed with local and Nordic ingredients such as cherries, sea buckthorn, raspberries, and lingonberries.\r\nHaandbryggeriet has since 2005 also made high quality sours and barrel aged beers such as porters and Christmas beers.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, we invested in a Rolec Craft brewing System which allowed us to give people new and exciting lager yeast beers in addition to our production of ales.\r\n\r\nIn 2016, we took our sour beer production a step further by starting a smaller brewery for our sour beers.\r\n\r\nWe use only first class ingredients and water from Glitre. Our beers are neither filtered or pastaurised.\r\nAt Haandbryggeriet we work zealously every day to give you new exciting high quality beers!",
