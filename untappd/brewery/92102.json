      "brewery_description": "We are a small craft brewery combining a fundamental passion for great beer with decades of experience from the industry. Our Brewmaster is Norway's grand old man of home brewing – and several times Norwegian homebrewing champion – Gahr Smith-Gahrsen. Our goal is to produce classic, yet innovative beer that will put Bergen on the international beer map.\r\n\r\nThe techniques and ingredients used in England in the 18th and 19th century have been a great source of inspiration for us. We want to respect these traditions, yet still try think in new ways and push the boundaries of brewing further. Our aim is to produce beer that is pure and balanced in taste, while still being innovative and exciting. We want to enable more people to explore the delights of craft beer; sipped on its own or paired with delicious food, enjoyed in solitude or with good friends.\r\n\r\nLess mass-production – more taste and passion\r\n\r\nPopular types like Pale Ale and India Pale Ale will form a natural core to our assortment of beers. In addition we want to do our own takes on classic styles like Brown Ale, Amber Ale, Stout and Barleywine, as well as Sour Ale made in the traditional Belgian Style. \r\nWe are also aiming to produce a continually changing selection of exciting seasonal beers, which are bound to include some old classics from the homebrewing days of our Brewmaster.",
