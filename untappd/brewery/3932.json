      "brewery_description": "John Boston was a jack-of-all-trades and a master of none.\n \nHe crafted Australia’s first beer in 1796 using corn bittered with love-apple stalks at his mill on Bennelong Point. Initial excitement quickly turned sour after the guards in Old Sydney Town tasted the drop. Boston tried his hand at many other things – republican, apothecary, trained surgeon and salt maker. Unable to provide any other value to the colony he departed our shores, but soon came to an end at the hands of the hungry cannibals on an island in the South Pacific.\n \nSo let’s celebrate the loveable rogue who tried his hand at everything. Rest assured, 200 years too late for John Boston, we’ve crafted these brews in Honour of the great man in a state-of-the-art brewery ensuring no stalks are included. When you’re savouring your beer at the end of the day take a moment to thank the man who began it all – John Boston, Australia’s First Brewer 1796.",
