      "brewery_description": "We are a bottle shop that makes beer! \n\nWe started brewing out of Willie The Boatman in St Peters on our custom built 1 Barrel brewing system. This allowed us to make small batches and experiment with ingredients and methods. \n\nOur bottle shop opened in October 2016, with 650+ different craft beers, 40+ craft ciders and a wide range of 100% independently owned and operated Australian wines and Australian spirits. There is also 4 beers on tap in our shop so you can bring a growler or a squealer (or just buy one of ours) and take home some delicious craft beer that we've brewed, or maybe something special from other breweries that we rotate on our taps. We even offer tasters to help you decide.\n\nWe have now moved on to up-scaling some of our favorite recipes so keep an eye out at your local for some exciting Bucket Boys beers that we are really proud of.\n\nOur address is 300 Illawarra Road, Marrickville. Come down and have a chat to our knowledgeable staff as we love talking all things craft beer and brewing.\n\nCheers!",
