      "brewery_description": "Birra Moretti Brewing Company was born in the midst of political unrest in the city of Udine in Italy around the 1800s. Udine and the whole Friuli region were plagued with Austro-Hungarian Empire and patriotic uprisings. Luigi Moretti came from a family of wealthy merchants in the region. Learning from his family business, Luigi had become quite familiar with the commercial trades of cereals, wine, food and beer. This became the inspiration to the foundation of Birra Moretti in 1859. Its first bottle came out in 1860 that later on expanded to six types of beers. In 1996, Birra Moretti was recently acquired by Heineken International and is now part of the Heineken brand.",
