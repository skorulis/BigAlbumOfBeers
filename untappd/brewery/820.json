      "brewery_description": "As the man who first successfully cultivated hops in Australia way back in the early 19th century, James Squire has achieved legendary status. Chuck Hahn is a man after James Squire’s heart, a passionate brewer who has made a significant impact on the beer-drinking landscape.\n\nIn 1988, Chuck Hahn converted a former furniture factory into the Hahn Brewery. Ten years later, the brewery was renamed The Malt Shovel Brewery, which takes its name from James Squire’s original brewing tavern ‘The Malt Shovel’. We think it’s safe to say that James Squire would approve.\n\nLocated in Sydney’s inner-city suburb of Camperdown, The Malt Shovel Brewery is home to a small team of expert brewers who, relying on minimal automation, experiment with hand-crafted, innovative brews. Together they’ve created instant classics for the James Squire range like One Fifty Lashes Pale Ale, The Chancer Golden Ale, Four Wives Pilsener, Stowaway IPA, Jack of Spades Porter and Hop Thief American-style Pale Ale.\n\nYou can almost taste the rich history and intense passion in each flavoursome drop. You can expect more outstanding craft beers in years to come from the team at The Malt Shovel Brewery who, just like James Squire before them, have an insatiable appetite to taste it all.",
