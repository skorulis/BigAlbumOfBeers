When Paul Theakston decided to establish his own independent brewery in his home town of Masham in 1992, no one could have predicted the journey that was to unfold.\r\n\r\nAs a brewing pioneer with true Yorkshire grit and determination, he forged Black Sheep Brewery, where quality, consistency and independence come first.\r\n\r\nAs our name suggests, we are Black Sheep. We behave differently, not afraid to follow what we believe

Protecting this beautiful landscape is vital to us at Black Sheep, and every drop of Respire contributes to tree planting in the Yorkshire Dales. Officially carbon neutral, Respire is the true pint with purpose.\r\n\r\nWe footprinted the brewing, packaging and distribution of Respire, and offset this with official carbon credits, funding high impact bio-diversity projects. \r\n\r\nCitra and Chinook hops take the lead in this fresh and hoppy Session IPA, packing bright citrus, tropical fruit and crisp pine notes. Backed up with light, sweet maltiness, rounding out in a refreshing bitter finish.\r\n\r\nA breed apart.","beer_style":"IPA - Session","has_had":false,"beer_active":1},"brewery":{"brewery_id":134,"brewery_name":"Black Sheep","brewery_slug":"black-sheep","brewery_page_url":"\/blacksheepbrewery","brewery_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/brewery_logos\/brewery-134_fac2e.jpeg","country_name":"England","contact":{"twitter":"BlackSheepBeer","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BlackSheepBrewery","url":"https:\/\/www.blacksheepbrewery.com"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Masham","brewery_state":"North Yorkshire","lat":54.2246,"lng":-1.65813},"brewery_active":1},"venue":{"venue_id":9917985,"venue_name":"Untappd at Home","venue_slug":"at-home","primary_category_key":null,"primary_category":null,"parent_category_id":"4e67e38e036454776db1fb3a","categories":{"count":1,"items":[{"category_key":"home_private","category_name":"Home (private)","category_id":"4bf58dd8d48988d103941735","is_primary":true}]},"location":{"venue_address":"","venue_city":"","venue_state":"NC","venue_country":"United States","lat":34.2346611,"lng":-77.9482117},"contact":{"twitter":"","venue_url":""},"foursquare":{"foursquare_id":"5e7b4d99c91df60008e8b168","foursquare_url":"https:\/\/4sq.com\/3bDWYuq"},"venue_icon":{"sm":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/venuelogos\/venue_9917985_b3a5d245_bg_64.png","md":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/venuelogos\/venue_9917985_b3a5d245_bg_88.png","lg":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/venuelogos\/venue_9917985_b3a5d245_bg_176.png?v=1"},"is_verified":true,"spotlights":[],"has_beer":false,"has_food":false,"has_wine":false,"has_spirits":false},"comments":{"total_count":0,"count":0,"items":[]},"toasts":{"total_count":0,"count":0,"auth_toast":false,"items":[]},"media":{"count":0,"items":[]},"source":{"app_name":"Untappd for Android - (V2)","app_website":"http:\/\/untpd.it\/androidapp"},"badges":{"retro_status":false,"count":1,"items":[{"badge_id":133460,"user_badge_id":1266656627,"badge_name":"Session Life (Level 6)","badge_description":"Keep the party rolling all day long with your favorite low ABV session IPAs.

YORKSHIRE. LAGER.\r\n\r\nAt our brewery in Masham, North Yorkshire, we brew 54 to a simple yet unique recipe that has Yorkshire authenticity at its heart. Every batch of 54 is brewed with fresh water from the Yorkshire Dales and is fermented in our iconic ‘Yorkshire Squares’ – a fermentation system that is rarely used elsewhere in the world. German Pilsner malt forms the base of 54 whilst a blend of noble hops from Bavaria give it a distinct, aromatic finish with vibrant floral notes aplenty.\r\n\r\nCrisp. Clean. Refreshing.\r\n\r\nTHE SOUL OF 54.\r\n\r\nThough the recipe is inspired by the classic lagers of Southern Germany, 54 is built on a foundation of true Yorkshire spirit. The ethos of 54 is to encourage people to travel, explore and to revel in the experiences that our amazing county has to offer. To experience the hills, vistas, rivers and people that make this part of the world so special.\r\n\r\nTHE NAME, ’54’.\r\n\r\nThe 54th parallel north is the line of latitude around the earth that passes through Masham, Yorkshre – the home of our brewery. We originally named our lager ’54° North’ but in July 2020, we abbreviated that to simply ’54’.","beer_style":"Lager - Helles","has_had":false,"beer_active":1},"brewery":{"brewery_id":134,"brewery_name":"Black Sheep","brewery_slug":"black-sheep","brewery_page_url":"\/blacksheepbrewery","brewery_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/brewery_logos\/brewery-134_fac2e.jpeg","country_name":"England","contact":{"twitter":"BlackSheepBeer","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BlackSheepBrewery","url":"https:\/\/www.blacksheepbrewery.com"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Masham","brewery_state":"North Yorkshire","lat":54.2246,"lng":-1.65813},"brewery_active":1},"venue":{"venue_id":115387,"venue_name":"The Boar's Head","venue_slug":"the-boar-s-head","primary_category_key":"Travel and Transportation","primary_category":"Travel and Transportation","parent_category_id":"4d4b7105d754a06379d81259","categories":{"count":2,"items":[{"category_key":"hotel","category_name":"Hotel","category_id":"4bf58dd8d48988d1fa931735","is_primary":true},{"category_key":"pub","category_name":"Pub","category_id":"4bf58dd8d48988d11b941735","is_primary":false}]},"location":{"venue_address":"Ripley, Near Harrogate, Yorkshire","venue_city":"Ripley","venue_state":"North Yorkshire","venue_country":"United Kingdom","lat":54.0398979,"lng":-1.5677973},"contact":{"twitter":"","venue_url":"http:\/\/www.boarsheadripley.co.uk"},"foursquare":{"foursquare_id":"4bd72944304fce72a92833ab","foursquare_url":"http:\/\/4sq.com\/8ZYkXE"},"venue_icon":{"sm":"https:\/\/ss3.4sqi.net\/img\/categories_v2\/travel\/hotel_bg_64.png","md":"https:\/\/ss3.4sqi.net\/img\/categories_v2\/travel\/hotel_bg_88.png","lg":"https:\/\/ss3.4sqi.net\/img\/categories_v2\/travel\/hotel_bg_512.png"},"is_verified":false,"spotlights":[],"has_beer":false,"has_food":false,"has_wine":false,"has_spirits":false},"comments":{"total_count":0,"count":0,"items":[]},"toasts":{"total_count":2,"count":1,"auth_toast":null,"items":[{"uid":3215651,"user":{"uid":3215651,"user_name":"snickell741","first_name":"Scott","last_name":"Nickell","bio":"","location":"","relationship":"none","user_avatar":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/profile\/24ff78cd5b5331c285f9d91174f0473b_100x100.jpg","account_type":"user","venue_details":[],"brewery_details":[]},"like_id":1600964732,"like_owner":false,"created_at":"Sat, 28 Dec 2024 22:33:56 +0000"}]},"media":{"count":1,"items":[{"photo_id":577342782,"photo":{"photo_img_sm":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=200&height=200&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2024_12_28\/9d135e77a91256916f99eb16782ff251_c_1445855126_raw.jpg","photo_img_md":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=640&height=640&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2024_12_28\/9d135e77a91256916f99eb16782ff251_c_1445855126_raw.jpg","photo_img_lg":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=1280&height=1280&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2024_12_28\/9d135e77a91256916f99eb16782ff251_c_1445855126_raw.jpg","photo_img_og":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/photos\/2024_12_28\/9d135e77a91256916f99eb16782ff251_c_1445855126_raw.jpg"}}]},"source":{"app_name":"Untappd for Android - (V2)","app_website":"http:\/\/untpd.it\/androidapp"},"badges":{"retro_status":false,"count":1,"items":[{"badge_id":2134,"user_badge_id":1266653096,"badge_name":"Lager Jack (Level 28)","badge_description":"After a long day, what better way to kick back than with a crisp and refreshing lager?
