      "brewery_description": "The tale of two brothers is one of determination, perseverance, getting stuck in and having a go.\nThey grabbed hold of every opportunity and definitely weren’t afraid of getting their hands dirty.\n\nBorn to Irish parents, James and John soon learned that the luck of the Irish was a myth.\n\nEverything they achieved in life was earned, not handed to them. They didn’t follow trails; they blazed them. And success didn’t come easy.\n\nThey suffered loads of setbacks on their path to creating a brewing legend; setbacks that would’ve made many men give up – but not these brothers. They gritted their teeth, rolled up their sleeves and kept going.\n\nFrom introducing new beers, to sponsoring sporting and community events, the brothers’ have-a-go spirit has always been at the forefront of everything we do. It’s them we have to thank for who we are today, and we’ll never forget that.",
