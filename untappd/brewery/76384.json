It’s in our bones – and our beers. We draw water from a natural aquifer beneath the brewery, so you could say our beers have the essence of Clare Valley as their backbone.\nOur core range includes a classic Australian style Pale Ale, a rich and malty Red Ale, a dark and delicious Extra Stout, and an easy drinking Summer Ale.\nAt CVBC, we’re all about good times spent with good friends drinking great beer.",
