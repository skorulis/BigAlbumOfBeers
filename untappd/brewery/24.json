In addition to our signature Allagash White—a Belgian-style wheat beer—you’ll find wild, sour, barrel-aged, and spontaneously fermented beers to try as well. We’re a Certified B Corp; our founder, Rob, won the James Beard Award for Outstanding Wine, Spirits, or Beer Professional in 2019; and we’ve been recognized as one of Maine’s best places to work for seven years running. We hope you’ll feel the shared passion of our staff when you stop by. Beyond beer, we’re always working on becoming more sustainable in our brewing and supporting our Portland community.\r\n\r\nIf you’re in the area, stop by and check out our tasting room!",
