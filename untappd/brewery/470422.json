      "brewery_description": "Inspired by the lack of a real English style bitter that can be drunk on either a hot or cold day, DUNBAR Brews are newcomers to the Sydney craft brewery scene. Founded by two Pomâ€™s and an Aussie with a passion for English bitters, the brewery takes its name from the DUNBAR, an English merchant ship which sunk off the coast of Sydney in 1857. Still one of the biggest maritime disasters in the country, it involved the remarkable rescue of a lone survivor and the subsequent approval for the Hornsby lighthouse to be built. Many a tribute has been made over the years. This is ours. Sample a taste of history.",
