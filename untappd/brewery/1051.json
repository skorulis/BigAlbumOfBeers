Using second-hand and makeshift equipment they opened the Redhook Ale Brewery inside a renovated transmission shop in Ballard, Seattle.\r\n\r\nFour decades later and the beer scene, just like our hometown of Seattle, looks very different. And though a lot has changed, we are still driven by our founder's original vision to make well-crafted, approachable beers for the people. Over the years the recipes may have changed, but the spirit of entrepreneurship and work-ethic still underlies everything we do in our pursuit of making the hardest-working beer in the fridge.","stats":{"total_count":848999,"unique_count":313626,"monthly_count":239,"weekly_count":67,"user_count":0,"age_on_service":5195.236759259259},"owners":{"count":1,"items":[{"brewery_id":0,"is_brewery_group":1,"brewery_name":"Tilray Brands"}]},"media":{"count":15,"items":[{"photo_id":577389139,"photo":{"photo_img_sm":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=200&height=200&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2024_12_29\/36914c00325f8e019e848955afeaf78f_c_1445953934_raw.jpg","photo_img_md":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=640&height=640&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2024_12_29\/36914c00325f8e019e848955afeaf78f_c_1445953934_raw.jpg","photo_img_lg":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=1280&height=1280&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2024_12_29\/36914c00325f8e019e848955afeaf78f_c_1445953934_raw.jpg","photo_img_og":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/photos\/2024_12_29\/36914c00325f8e019e848955afeaf78f_c_1445953934_raw.jpg"},"created_at":"Sun, 29 Dec 2024 02:15:20 +0000","checkin_id":1445953934,"beer":{"bid":7667,"beer_name":"Big Ballard","beer_abv":8.6,"beer_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/beer_logos\/beer-7667_7fece_sm.jpeg","beer_style":"IPA -
