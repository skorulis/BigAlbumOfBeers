Here we brew our beers from the snow melt that surrounds us and utilise the perfect fermentation temperatures we find in the small crevices we call home. \r\n\r\nEach keg is then brought down from the peak by fixed ropes and then skied down to the Kawarau for delivery by raft. \r\n\r\nWhilst the above process might take a while and could possibly be stretching the truth...we believe that every beer should be an adventure. We brew for the love of it and the love of our people and environment.","stats":{"total_count":34375,"unique_count":11386,"monthly_count":319,"weekly_count":2,"user_count":0,"age_on_service":4019.674212962963},"owners":{"count":0,"items":[]},"media":{"count":15,"items":[{"photo_id":569782994,"photo":{"photo_img_sm":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=200&height=200&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2024_11_09\/9acbfbdf88bcd0ddb5fa5d325c8d0f79_c_1432044374_raw.jpg","photo_img_md":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=640&height=640&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2024_11_09\/9acbfbdf88bcd0ddb5fa5d325c8d0f79_c_1432044374_raw.jpg","photo_img_lg":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=1280&height=1280&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2024_11_09\/9acbfbdf88bcd0ddb5fa5d325c8d0f79_c_1432044374_raw.jpg","photo_img_og":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/photos\/2024_11_09\/9acbfbdf88bcd0ddb5fa5d325c8d0f79_c_1432044374_raw.jpg"},"created_at":"Sat, 09 Nov 2024 00:01:41 +0000","checkin_id":1432044374,"beer":{"bid":5488566,"beer_name":"Queenstown Lager","beer_abv":4,"beer_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/beer_logos\/beer-5488566_6bf79_sm.jpeg","beer_style":"Lager -

Pouring a perfect clear pale yellow this IPA is fermented cold giving it a very light and dry body that makes this beer incredibly crisp and like the first brew its cleaner than a Singaporean bus station. Enhancing this crispiness is a smooth yet prominent, tongue coating bitterness giving length to the west coast style. At 6 percent we have dialed back the abv from the first brew and this time hopped it with mosaic and motueka giving a dank tropical aroma that jumps from the glass.

Nothing better than the real thing for making flavour and aroma! We took a nice, light and sweet malt base with plenty of creamy oats and a bit of lactose and created a hazy IPA by stuffing it full of pineapplely hops. Nectaron, citra and simcoe. Then when it wasn't quite finished we then stuffed it with 15kg of Freeze dried pineapple - equivalet to 150kg of fresh pineapple! Pouring a beautiful light yellow colour with a clean haze, this beer is juice-centric and has plenty of tangy pineapple flowing out mixed in with some stonefruit and pine notes. A full body, lots of fruit flavour and a mellow bitterness round out the flavour. \r\n","beer_style":"IPA - New England \/ Hazy","has_had":false,"beer_active":1},"brewery":{"brewery_id":89782,"brewery_name":"Altitude Brewing","brewery_slug":"altitude-brewing","brewery_page_url":"\/Altitude_Brewing","brewery_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/brewery_logos\/brewery-89782_d7417.jpeg","country_name":"New Zealand","contact":{"twitter":"altitudebrewing","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/altitudebrewingnz","url":"https:\/\/www.altitudebrewing.co.nz"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Queenstown","brewery_state":"Otago","lat":-45.0312,"lng":168.663},"brewery_active":1},"venue":{"venue_id":9917985,"venue_name":"Untappd at Home","venue_slug":"at-home","primary_category_key":null,"primary_category":null,"parent_category_id":"4e67e38e036454776db1fb3a","categories":{"count":1,"items":[{"category_key":"home_private","category_name":"Home (private)","category_id":"4bf58dd8d48988d103941735","is_primary":true}]},"location":{"venue_address":"","venue_city":"","venue_state":"NC","venue_country":"United States","lat":34.2346611,"lng":-77.9482117},"contact":{"twitter":"","venue_url":""},"foursquare":{"foursquare_id":"5e7b4d99c91df60008e8b168","foursquare_url":"https:\/\/4sq.com\/3bDWYuq"},"venue_icon":{"sm":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/venuelogos\/venue_9917985_b3a5d245_bg_64.png","md":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/venuelogos\/venue_9917985_b3a5d245_bg_88.png","lg":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/venuelogos\/venue_9917985_b3a5d245_bg_176.png?v=1"},"is_verified":true,"spotlights":[],"has_beer":false,"has_food":false,"has_wine":false,"has_spirits":false},"comments":{"total_count":0,"count":0,"items":[]},"toasts":{"total_count":0,"count":0,"auth_toast":false,"items":[]},"media":{"count":1,"items":[{"photo_id":569595596,"photo":{"photo_img_sm":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=200&height=200&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2024_11_08\/ff9e8da3dc932392e7be75e33164a9a1_c_1431722298_raw.jpg","photo_img_md":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=640&height=640&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2024_11_08\/ff9e8da3dc932392e7be75e33164a9a1_c_1431722298_raw.jpg","photo_img_lg":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=1280&height=1280&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2024_11_08\/ff9e8da3dc932392e7be75e33164a9a1_c_1431722298_raw.jpg","photo_img_og":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/photos\/2024_11_08\/ff9e8da3dc932392e7be75e33164a9a1_c_1431722298_raw.jpg"}}]},"source":{"app_name":"Untappd for Android - (V4)","app_website":"http:\/\/untpd.it\/androidapp"},"badges":{"retro_status":false,"count":1,"items":[{"badge_id":1805,"user_badge_id":1252749166,"badge_name":"Photogenic Brew  (Level 19)","badge_description":"It takes the perfect amount of light, the right framing and a touch of creative love to get the perfect picture of your brew.
