      "brewery_description": "We make beer. Handcrafted, naturally unfiltered, undiminished, untamed and unbelievable tasty.\n\nThe Prancing Pony is a craft Brewery located in the Adelaide Hills, South Australia. The beers of the Prancing Pony Brewery are created by the Head Brewer Frank Samson and his passion for beer.  His unlimited imagination drives him to craft beers with unsurpassed, long and lingering flavours made from the purest, best ingredients and using traditional brewing methods.  \n\nRight from our humble beginnings, the Pony has won accolades and awards for its beers.  The brewery is the proud holder of the Champion Trophy for Small Brewery (awarded to the highest scoring Small Australian Brewery 2015), and has won the Champion Medallion for its India Red Ale and Amber Ale. As a business, the Prancing Pony Brewery has received many accolades.\n\nAt the Pony, our unique brewery door outlet “The Brewshed” is located right inside our commercial brewing space. At the brewshed you will encounter a stable of carefully crafted long flavoured beers, plus one-off and short run brews that are available only at the Brewshed.\n\nThe Pony knows that putting on the feedbag is part of the fun. All our dishes are created “from the beer up” to match our brews. Featuring fresh local ingredients, you can enjoy small bites, burgers, regional tasting platters and family friendly fare. \n\n",
