Do you know who else loves a good time? John Travolta. Man, that guy can boogie! We're not great dancers but we can make some damn tasty beers. So we’re throwing a party for your mouth, and you’re invited… introducing our Silent Disco Double Dry Hop Pale.\r\n\r\nFlavours can’t be heard, but if they could, this would be a certified banger. The Azacca, Chinook & Ella hop combination add stone fruit and tropical elements to the subtle biscuit and toffee malt finish. The result is a fruity and lush beer, with a full body and crisp finish. This is one party you don’t want to miss out on.
