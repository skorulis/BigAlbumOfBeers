In 1976, His Royal Highness Prince Luitpold of Bavaria, great-grandson of the last Bavarian King Ludwig III, took over the helm of Castle Kaltenberg and its brewery. Within 30 years under his management, the formerly small, regional, privately-held brewery grew into an internationally successful enterprise. By focusing on high-end Bavarian beer specialties as well as the royal Bavarian heritage, the brewery first established the brand within the Bavarian region, but grew steadily into a national brand.",
