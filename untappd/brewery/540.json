Nectar imprisoned in a bottle. An anything-but-delicate blend of sharp hoppiness and fruity aroma, this beer is a life-changing backyard knife-fight for your palate. Once you’ve had a Raging Bitch, everything else pales in comparison. Fermented with a volcano-like Belgian yeast strain called “El Diablo,” Raging Bitch earned its polarizing name from the aggressively active nature of the yeast—unleashed, untamed, unbridled...and in heat. Enjoy its golden glow and white foaming head alongside bold flavors like spicy BBQ wings, blue cheese salads, or that bag of family-sized Cool Ranch Doritos you’re going to destroy later while binge-watching Netflix.","is_in_production":1,"created_at":"Sat, 21 Aug 2010 14:26:35 +0000","user_rating_score":0,"rating_score":3.639,"rating_count":232729,"has_had":null,"on_list":false,"auth_rating":0,"wish_list":false},"brewery":{"brewery_id":540,"brewery_name":"Flying Dog Brewery","brewery_slug":"flying-dog-brewery","brewery_page_url":"\/flyingdog","brewery_type":"Regional Brewery","brewery_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/brewery_logos\/brewery-540_27433.jpeg","country_name":"United States","contact":{"twitter":"flyingdog","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/flyingdog","instagram":"flyingdogbrewery","url":"https:\/\/www.flyingdog.com"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Utica","brewery_state":"NY","lat":43.1044006,"lng":-75.2454987},"brewery_active":1},"friends":{"items":[],"count":0}},{"total_user_count":0,"has_had":null,"total_count":309816,"beer":{"bid":3759,"beer_name":"Snake Dog IPA","beer_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/beer_logos\/beer-3759_9ffde_sm.jpeg","beer_style":"IPA - American","beer_abv":7.1,"beer_ibu":60,"beer_slug":"flying-dog-brewery-snake-dog-ipa","beer_description":"A potent snakebite of Citra, Mosaic, Warrior, Simcoe, and Columbus hops (more than 2lbs per barrel) gives this beer its citrus-forward superpower.
