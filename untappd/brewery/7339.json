For the last 3 years we’ve been the largest brewpub in the nation, based on beer production & we’ve been voted the Best Brewery in WA State.  America’s Best Brews (by Steve Johnson) even named us as one of the top 25 breweries in the United States.\n\nWe opened in 1995 and have been making great handcrafted beer & upscale pub food for the Bellingham, WA community ever since. Our brewery is located in a restored historic 1922 warehouse in Downtown Bellingham, across from the Saturday Farmer’s Market.  The building also houses a Taproom and Bistro where customers can enjoy one of 10 beers on tap.",
