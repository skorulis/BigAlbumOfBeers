      "brewery_description": "We are Tiny Rebel, an award-winning brewery from Newport, South Wales. We are the youngest and only Welsh brewery to win Champion beer of Britain. We are the only brewery to have won Gold, Silver and Bronze in the Champion Beer of Wales Competition (in our first year!) and the only brewery to defend a Gold the following year. We were also SIBA Brewery Business of the Year and International Beer Challenge UK Brewer of the Year 2016. But really, we’re just fans of super tasty beer. From two guys in a garage to a bespoke brewery with thousands of fans, we’ve grown a lot since 2012. Since then, every year has been bigger and better. We're showing no signs of slowing down - countless projects on the go and more exciting stuff to show off soon!",
