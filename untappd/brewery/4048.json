      "brewery_description": "Since 1859, the West End Brewery has been a major player in the state of South Australia. This landmark brewery, along with our trademark brand West End Draught, has embedded itself into the cultural and economic heritage of South Australia.\n\nThe company was officially formed into the South Australian Brewing, Malting, Wine and Spirit company in 1888, merging the West End Brewery (Adelaide), the Kent Town Brewery (Kent Town) and the wine and spirit business of Rounsevell and Simms. In 1894 once wine and spirits were sold off, the South Australian Brewing Company was established. Production was concentrated at the original West End Brewery, in the city of Adelaide, which had been established in 1859 and remained there until 1980, when the brewery moved to the Southwark Brewery in the suburb of Thebarton.\n\nThere have been brewing operations at 107 Port Road since 1886 when it commenced as the Torrenside Brewery, and then became the Southwark Brewery and ultimately West End Brewery.  The original Brewhouse Tower still remains on site and hosts many brewery tours and functions under the affectionate name of the Tower Bar.",
