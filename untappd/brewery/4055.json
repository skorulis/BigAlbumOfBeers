      "brewery_description": "Mountain Goat is a pioneer of Australia’s craft beer scene, with the first beer – our Hightail amber ale - hitting pubs back in 1997. The brewery and Goat Bar still operate in the back streets of Richmond in Victoria with a lineup of old favourites on tap, brewery exclusives beers and cracking pizzas. \n\nFrom our Steam Ale, one of Australia’s first organic beers; to our Summer Ale, a refreshing thirst-quencher available in cans and perfect for everything outdoors; through to our award-winning Rare Breeds and Barrel Breeds, limited in number but unrestrained in flavour, technique and creativity.  \n\nWe open the brewery to public every Wednesday and Friday nights from 5pm and Sunday afternoons. We usually have something special to the brewery on tap and cook rockin’ pizzas (we cater for vegetarians, vegans and our gluten-intolerant friends too). On Wednesday nights we hold free brewery tours at 6.30 – no need to book, just sign up at the bar. \n\n",
