The Company is owned by a group of passionate mates, locals to Balmain, with the following vision: \n\n• Becoming Sydney’s own iconic local beer company, representing tradition, mates and pub culture \n\n• Brewing hand-crafted quality beer \n\n• Having the majority of pubs in Sydney pouring a Balmain Brewing Company beer \n\n• Establish a Balmain Brewing Company microbrewery/restaurant on the peninsula. \n\nThe mates dreamed up the plan while drinking over the years in each of Balmain’s 17 pubs, and hearing about the Balmain Brewery of last century and the 55 pubs of the 1800’s!",
