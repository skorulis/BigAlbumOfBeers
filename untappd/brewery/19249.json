      "brewery_description": "James Boag understood that there’s nothing on earth quite like Tasmania’s natural purity. Which means there are no other beers like James Boag’s.\n\nOur history starts in 1881, on the banks of the Esk River in Launceston. It was in the brewery built right here that James Boag and son established their tradition of brewing excellence.\n\nTo the best of Tasmania’s pure water and natural ingredients, the Boag’s Brewers added their pride, passion and superior craft and equipment, to quickly forge a reputation for making beers that were far from ordinary.\n\nToday, the James Boag Brewery still insists on using crisp Tasmanian water, and only the finest hops and barley, to produce a range of exceptional beers. Each bottle we make represents the purity and wonder of our island home, and our ongoing commitment to brewing excellence.\n\nFrom the Tarkine wilderness to the crystal waters of Wine Glass Bay, from the wild Southern Ocean to the heights of Cradle Mountain … this is Tasmania. Rugged and isolated, our island home sits on the edge of the world. Who would have thought this challenging setting would provide the ideal conditions for brewing some of Australia’s best-loved beers?",
