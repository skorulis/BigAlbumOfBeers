      "brewery_description": "Killer Sprocket is a small brewing company founded in 2012 by Sean and Andrea Ryan. Our recipes have been developed through years of home brewing and reflect our passion for full flavoured ales.\n\nOur maiden release is was the Killer Sprocket Amber Ale, a darker shade of amber with chocolate and crystal malts balanced by a generous addition of three distinct hop varieties. In December 2013 we released our follow up beer Killer Sprocket Bandit, a peated pale ale a medley of biscuit, dark fruit, toffee, spice and smoke flavours.\n\nInitially we produced our delicious beers with the help of our friends at Southern Bay Brewing. In late 2013 we made a move to The Cavalier Brewery west of Melbourne.",
