Our pubs serve our beer and fresh food, in sustainably-built and operated buildings that have a relaxed, family-friendly atmosphere.\r\n\r\nHopworks is family-owned and operated, employing over 160 people in the Pacific Northwest. We serve our neighborhoods through donations, profit sharing and volunteering with local, non-profit organizations. From composting to salvaged materials, and from pervious pavers to hand dryers, we have made every effort to protect our future with thoughtful alternatives. We are the first Certified B Corporation brewery in the Pacific Northwest and our campus is the first Salmon-Safe Certified brewery in the world.",
