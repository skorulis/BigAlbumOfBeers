All four of them had been tossing around the idea of creating a business together and craft beer had been discussed. \r\n\r\nWe don’t know whether it was the sunsets on the Savannah, one too many G&T’s on safari or just the combination of good food, good people and the great atmosphere, but we came back determined that we could do this, we could build a Craft Brewery business. \r\n\r\nAnd just like that, we did. \r\n\r\nWe have built a Craft Brewery in Blueridge Business Park, Dubbo NSW, Australia. \r\n\r\nYes, Dubbo - home of the world famous Taronga Western Plains Zoo, and is now also home to it’s first Craft Brewery.\r\n\r\nWe thought long and hard about the location and layout of the venue, the range of beer that would appeal to our market, and most importantly, the vibe of the venue and crew that will help create this.",
