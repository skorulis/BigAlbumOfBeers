      "brewery_description": "An Irish man walks into a bar... classic start to every Irish joke. Only this time, said Irishman meets an Aussie and they fall in love. \r\nOwners Dave Henderson and Shiree Phillips met in Sydney a few moons ago and they bonded over their love of the amber ale.\r\nIn 2016, Dave bought a brewery in Orange off Gumtree Australia (without his wife knowing) to make homebrew in a shed in the backyard of their home in Bexley, St George, NSW. \r\nThey embarked on making Aussie beer without bullshit with a touch of Irish Charm - just approachable & friendly, like those hailing from the Emerald Isle.\r\nWe use local ingredients where possible - from honey sourced from Shiree's hometown Mudgee for our ginger beer to growing our own hops for our seasonal harvest ales. We strive for low impact practices & closed loop systems, using cans that can be recycled and our spent grain going to farmers to feed cows in drought, as well as our compost to grow our hops.\r\nOur flagship beers are Irish Red Ale, Bitter Ale, Mudgee Honey Ginger Beer and Choc-Cherry Stout. No fancy names - just good, well made beer.",
