      "brewery_description": "Fallen Angel Brewery was established in East Sussex in 2004 and soon became popular with its unique chilli ales and ciders. Combining the well documented benefits of beer with the nutritional benefits of chilli’s, including boosting circulation, improving heart health and lowering cholesterol not to mention the endorphin rush. Fallen Angel became widely known across the chilli fraternity and beer enthusiasts. It’s tagline being “modern ales- brewed traditionally”, the brewery continues to experiment and expand its range. In 2012 the brewery moved to the East of England and Broxbourne Brewery became the home of the Fallen Angel.\n",
