      "brewery_description": "As recently as the mid 90’s, Greece did in fact have several airlines, but the late, great Frank Zappa would undoubtedly have been upset by the fact that the land of his forefathers still didn’t have a single, 100% Greek beer.\r\nThat’s why when the very first bottles of “Vergina” went on sale in 1998, our mission was twofold: to craft one of the finest premium lagers money could buy – anywhere, at any price – while at the same time rectifying the glaring omission of which the legendary Zappa spoke.\r\nMuch to our surprise, what started out as a small, committed band of beer lovers’ quest to bring back the lost art of beer-craft to the Thracian heartland soon blossomed into something much greater than we could have ever hoped for: our “Vergina” brand had not only evolved into the catalyst that would revolutionize beer culture in Greece, but also began attracting an ever growing number of devoted fans in the four corners of the globe - from the surf lodges of Australia to New York City’s finest restaurants.\r\nThe history of beer brewing in the Hellenic world is well documented throughout antiquity – perhaps most famously in the 10th Century Byzantine codex entitled “Peri Zython Pioiseos” (“On the Crafting of Beers”) – furthermore, the ancient Greeks were well aware of the exceptional quality of the natural spring waters of Northern Greece, and archaeological finds confirm that Thrace was one of the very first locations in Europe where beer fermentation took place.",
