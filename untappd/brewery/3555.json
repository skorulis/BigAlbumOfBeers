      "brewery_description": "8 Wired Brewery is created by Soren Eriksen. This brewery originated in Marlborough, New Zealand and has thrived through simply renting supplies from the Renaissance Brewing Company. In New Zealand, the no. 8 wire is a gauge of wire that is used for electric fencing, which the Kiwis have always used to create and fix anything. This Kiwi mentality became the inspiration to the birth of ‘8 Wired’ with a purpose of maximizing the resources available in an effort to produce wide variety of refreshing and unique flavors of beer. Currently, 8 Wired Brewery beers are available to New Zealand, United States, Canada, Australia and Denmark.  Relocated to Warkworth in 2015",
