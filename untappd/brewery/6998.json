      "brewery_description": "Cricketers Arms was created in 2009 by Paul Scott as a tribute to his father. As a boy he would watch on as his father played cricket and shared beers with the opposing team post-match. With Scott’s passion as a publican and the experience and expertise of brewer Dermot O’Donnell, a contemporary, flavoursome and quality beer was born. Cricketers Arms is an approachable brand with a strong sense of traditional values: helping mates, playing hard, losing gracefully, having a laugh and taking pride in yourself and the community. Cricketers Arms honours friendships and celebrates communities.",
