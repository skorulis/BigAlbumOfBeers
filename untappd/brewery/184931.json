      "brewery_description": "Established in 2014 by three Adelaide craft beer enthusiasts, Jared Birbeck, Peter Lynn and Antony Tropeano, with The dream of crafting something that represented our passion for good quality beer. After many trials and experimentations our inaugural brew ’13’ Pale Ale was released in summer of 2015.\n\nOur brewing philosophy is to create beers that allow the flavours and aromas from each ingredient to flourish, with each having it’s own story to tell. Nothing over complicated, using quality Australian ingredients for the Australian climate. Jared, our head-brewer, has spent many devoted hours developing each recipe. Preserving true craftsmanship, using quality natural ingredients, traditional techniques & with no artificial ingredients, flavours or preservatives being added. Our goal is to introduce beer drinkers to flavoursome & aromatic beers & turn them into enthusiasts, like us, who have a genuine appreciation for how good craft beer can be!\n\nWhilst we’re based in Adelaide, South Australia, we brew our beers at various local breweries and are proud to call ourselves ‘Gypsy Brewers’. Our clan has grown recently and have appointed our ‘Head Gypsy’ Jarrad Hyde to hit the road & distribute our beers to watering hole near you!   ",
