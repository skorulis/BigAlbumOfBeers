In the background, facing each other, are two enemy fortresses: the Montorgueil tower and the castle of Crevecoeur. A lay master brewer worked for the abbey and made a Leffe beer that was so delicious that the parishioners preferred to drink a Leffe on Sundays rather than go to church. The abbot had to take forceful action.\r\n\r\nThe abbey and the brewery were closed during the French Revolution and seemed to be nothing but a distant memory, until the abbey was re-established in 1929. In 1952 abbot Nys and Albert Lootvoet decided to once again take up the brewing tradition of Leffe with its well-guarded recipe and offer a range of delicious Leffe beers. In the meantime, AB-InBev has taken up the torch and has made a commitment to honour the tradition of the Leffe beer, which has been brewed according to the same recipe since 1240.","stats":{"total_count":2555274,"unique_count":773175,"monthly_count":9906,"weekly_count":15,"user_count":0,"age_on_service":5203.259918981482},"owners":{"count":1,"items":[{"brewery_id":0,"is_brewery_group":1,"brewery_name":"Anheuser-Busch

Such a magnificent place could not be forgotten, he believed, and he vowed to bring the Leffe beer back. Father Nys and the brewer set about the challenge with vigour‚Ä¶and succeeded. Shortly after, the Leffe brewery was back in full effect. After Leffe Brown, a beer that shone brighter than the sun saw the light of day; they named it Leffe Blond ‚Äì a beautiful chapter for Leffe indeed.\r\n\r\nLeffe Blond is the flagship of Leffe. The unique recipe is the fruit of centuries of experience in the art of brewing, which brings a broad palette of aromas into balance. It is elegant, smooth and fruity, and it has a spicy aftertaste with a hint of bitter orange. Its light, sunny colour is due to the use of pale malt. Leffe Blond contains 6.6 % alcohol and fits excellently with a wide variety of dishes. It is best at a temperature of 5¬∞ to 6¬∞ Celsius.

In the heart of the Leffe district lies an abbey well-known among the village locals. One morning, the Premonstratensian Fathers that live in the abbey hold a meeting in the refectory on a subject that concerns all the inhabitants of Dinant: how can they avoid the epidemics that spread through contaminated water? After giving the subject some serious thought, the monks come to the idea to purify the water through a process they knew only too well: by turning it into beer. \u2028Before long, the inhabitants of Dinant have the pleasure of discovering a deep, dark brown beer, and thousands of pilgrims passing through are more than happy to sample the monks‚Äô hospitality. Leffe Brown was born. \r\n\r\n‚ÄúLeffe Brown‚Äôs soft, deep brown colour and the perfect balance between a discreetly bitter yet slightly caramelised taste can be ascribed to age-old traditions. Hints of coffee and chocolate provide this beer with an even more desirable flavour.

In the heart of the Leffe district lies an abbey well-known among the village locals. One morning, the Premonstratensian Fathers that live in the abbey hold a meeting in the refectory on a subject that concerns all the inhabitants of Dinant: how can they avoid the epidemics that spread through contaminated water? After giving the subject some serious thought, the monks come to the idea to purify the water through a process they knew only too well: by turning it into beer. \u2028Before long, the inhabitants of Dinant have the pleasure of discovering a deep, dark brown beer, and thousands of pilgrims passing through are more than happy to sample the monks‚Äô hospitality. Leffe Brown was born. \r\n\r\n‚ÄúLeffe Brown‚Äôs soft, deep brown colour and the perfect balance between a discreetly bitter yet slightly caramelised taste can be ascribed to age-old traditions. Hints of coffee and chocolate provide this beer with an even more desirable flavour. Served in a Leffe chalice, the smooth, creamy beer head, the roasted aromas and the spiced flavour have the ability to suspend time.‚Äù","beer_style":"Brown Ale - Belgian","has_had":false,"beer_active":1},"brewery":{"brewery_id":5,"brewery_name":"Abbaye de Leffe","brewery_slug":"abbaye-de-leffe","brewery_page_url":"\/w\/abbaye-de-leffe\/5","brewery_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/brewery_logos\/brewery-5_60e12.jpeg","country_name":"Belgium","contact":{"twitter":"Leffe","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Leffe","url":"https:\/\/leffe.com"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Leuven","brewery_state":"Vlaams Gewest","lat":50.8899,"lng":4.70832},"brewery_active":1},"venue":[],"comments":{"total_count":0,"count":0,"items":[]},"toasts":{"total_count":0,"count":0,"auth_toast":false,"items":[]},"media":{"count":0,"items":[]},"source":{"app_name":"Untappd for iPhone - (V4)","app_website":"http:\/\/untpd.it\/iphoneapp"},"badges":{"retro_status":false,"count":1,"items":[{"badge_id":34619,"user_badge_id":1267116076,"badge_name":"Hopped Down (Level 15)","badge_description":"One cannot live on dank hops alone.

Such a magnificent place could not be forgotten, he believed, and he vowed to bring the Leffe beer back. Father Nys and the brewer set about the challenge with vigour‚Ä¶and succeeded. Shortly after, the Leffe brewery was back in full effect. After Leffe Brown, a beer that shone brighter than the sun saw the light of day; they named it Leffe Blond ‚Äì a beautiful chapter for Leffe indeed.\r\n\r\nLeffe Blond is the flagship of Leffe. The unique recipe is the fruit of centuries of experience in the art of brewing, which brings a broad palette of aromas into balance. It is elegant, smooth and fruity, and it has a spicy aftertaste with a hint of bitter orange. Its light, sunny colour is due to the use of pale malt. Leffe Blond contains 6.6 % alcohol and fits excellently with a wide variety of dishes. It is best at a temperature of 5¬∞ to 6¬∞ Celsius.
