Belhaven Brewery was family owned until 1984 and since then has been subject to continual investment, and more recently the addition of a new Brewhouse in 2011.\n\nThe portfolio of products brewed at Belhaven is diverse and includes cask ales such as Belhaven IPA and 80/- as well as keg products, including Belhaven’s flagship brand and Scotland’s number one ale brand, Belhaven Best. You’ll find Belhaven beers across the globe,  exported as far away as Australia.",
