Consequently in April 2007 BrewDog was born.\n\nBoth only 24 at the time, we leased a building in Fraserburgh, got some scary bank loans, spent all our money on stainless steel and started making some hardcore craft beers.\n\nWe brewed tiny batches, filled bottles by hand and sold our beers at local markets and out of the back of our beat up old van.\n\nOur biggest mission when we set up BrewDog was to make other people as passionate about great craft beer as we are. And that is still our biggest mission today.",
