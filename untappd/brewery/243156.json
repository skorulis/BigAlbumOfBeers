      "brewery_description": "Stone Dog Meadery is a small artisan brewing company dedicated to giving you a new taste experience. Mead.\nOur Meads are produced on a small scale allowing us to craft them into outstanding beverages.\nWe focus on using honey from single sources, this means the bees have been predominantly feeding on a single type of plant ie Orange trees or Red Gum Eucalypts etc. This allows us to bring out the unique flavours found in these honeys and present them to you in many and varied ways.\nMuch like wine and beer, our Meads pair well with different foods. Anything from hors dâ€™oeuvres, seafood, meats and game through to desserts and cheese platters.\nWe use the best quality honey sourced from New South Wales, Canberra and Victoria.\nWe also like to push the boundaries and combinations, much like our new braggot Oranz is the new Vlad which combines an orange blossom honey sweet mead aged in rum barrels with a Russian Imperial stout and in whisky barrels.\nStone Dog Meadery was founded on the principles of respect for the bees, the producers of our most important ingredient and to be as low impact on the environment as possible. To live up to these principles, we work closely with the bee keeping associations in both ACT and NSW. We also ensure all our packaging is reusable / recyclable and that our waste water and electricity usage is kept to a minimum.\n",
