We believe that there is so much more to beer than we've previously been told and our hope is to redeem and reclaim back what beer really is - a centre for community, a craft to enjoy, and a drink to really taste.\n​\nWe also believe that together we can bring change to a world that desperately needs it.  We are committed to donating 10% of our profits to Oxfam to partner with them in the fight of bringing clean drinking water to those around the globe who still today have no access to any. \n \nToday 663 million people are living with no access to clean water. It’s a staggering number, and one that we need to see dramatically change. That's what we mean when we say \"cheers to change\".",
