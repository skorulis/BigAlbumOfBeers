Massively successful, and ever full of vip and vinegar, Arrogant Bastard Ale split off from the restrictive confines of Stone Brewing in 2015. And now, the brethren of Liquid Arrogance is free to explore, cavort and roam how they damn well see fit. For those Worthy few that wish to gaze upon the musings of Arrogant Bastard Ale, Double Bastard Ale, Bourbon Barrel-Aged Arrogant Bastard or other Arrogant Brewing beers, follow along via Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Arrogantbastard.com.",
