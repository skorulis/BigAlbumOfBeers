From a small, renovated mechanic's garage located in Salt Lake City, Uinta began distributing a variety of beer throughout the valley and has since expanded to a 5-acre campus with over 100 employees and a distribution footprint reaching 36 states. Named after an east-west mountain range located in northeastern Utah, many of Uinta's beer names are inspired by Utah's diverse landscapes and history. Fully committed to minimizing their impact on the environment, Uinta brews with 100% Renewable Energy and has lead the way in sustainable brewing since 2001. ",
