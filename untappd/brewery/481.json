      "brewery_description": "Hardworking. Passionate. Original. Innovators. That’s how we describe the people of Humboldt County, California, and we sought out to capture that pioneering spirit in a bottle. In a glass. On tap. In the world’s best brewed beer.\n\nAs avid home-brewers, co-owners Ted Vivatson and Margaret Frigon had a vision of excellent hand-crafted beer and great food in historic surroundings. The vision came to fruition in 1995 and the beer began to flow at the former site of the Clay Brown Redwood lumber mill in Fortuna, California.\n \nRemnants of the old mill can still be seen in our beer garden, one of the best places to enjoy some of the best beer on a sunny day. Inside the Pub you'll see historic photographs of the mill and various other Humboldt County scenes from days gone by.\n\nAlthough we've moved our brewing facility up river to the site of another historic mill in Scotia, California, small batches of specialty beers are still brewed at the Pub and Restaurant in Fortuna.",
