Notes of grapefruit peel, peach, white grape, and nectarine jump out of the glass. \r\n\r\nWe've crafted a beer as a bright as the midday sun! The combination of our creamy, hazy profile with lightly kilned grains creates the golden, glowing Double IPA in your glass! For this iteration within our color series, we dialed back our darker crystal malts in pursuit of a rich, brilliant yellow appearance. Underneath its peaks of sticky, foam, we've crafted a New Zealand-heavy hop bill to accentuate its bright qualities. Notes of grapefruit peel, peach, white grape, and nectarine jump out of the glass. The beer you are holding represents our creative spirit and the craftsmanship to bring these concepts to fruition.","beer_style":"IPA - Imperial \/ Double New England \/ Hazy","has_had":false,"beer_active":1},"brewery":{"brewery_id":20084,"brewery_name":"Tree House Brewing Company","brewery_slug":"tree-house-brewing-company","brewery_page_url":"\/treehousebrewco","brewery_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/brewery_logos\/brewery-treehousebrewingcompany_20084.jpeg","country_name":"United States","contact":{"twitter":"TreeHouseBrewCo","facebook":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/treehousebrewco","url":"http:\/\/www.treehousebrew.com"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Charlton","brewery_state":"MA","lat":42.1401,"lng":-72.0153},"brewery_active":1},"venue":{"venue_id":9917985,"venue_name":"Untappd at Home","venue_slug":"at-home","primary_category_en":null,"primary_category":null,"parent_category_id":"4e67e38e036454776db1fb3a","categories":{"count":1,"items":[{"category_key":"home_private","category_name_en":"Home (private)","category_name":"Home (private)","category_id":"4bf58dd8d48988d103941735","is_primary":true}]},"location":{"venue_address":"","venue_city":"","venue_state":"NC","venue_country":"United States","lat":34.2346611,"lng":-77.9482117},"contact":{"twitter":"","venue_url":""},"foursquare":{"foursquare_id":"5e7b4d99c91df60008e8b168","foursquare_url":"https:\/\/4sq.com\/3bDWYuq"},"venue_icon":{"sm":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/venuelogos\/venue_9917985_b3a5d245_bg_64.png","md":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/venuelogos\/venue_9917985_b3a5d245_bg_88.png","lg":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/venuelogos\/venue_9917985_b3a5d245_bg_176.png?v=1"},"is_verified":true,"spotlights":[],"has_beer":false,"has_food":false,"has_wine":false,"has_spirits":false},"comments":{"total_count":0,"count":0,"items":[]},"toasts":{"total_count":0,"count":0,"auth_toast":false,"items":[]},"media":{"count":1,"items":[{"photo_id":616290905,"photo":{"photo_img_sm":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=200&height=200&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2025_09_26\/7c608e8d702a8312df29221602d3f543_c_1516258776_raw.jpg","photo_img_md":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=640&height=640&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2025_09_26\/7c608e8d702a8312df29221602d3f543_c_1516258776_raw.jpg","photo_img_lg":"https:\/\/images.untp.beer\/crop?width=1280&height=1280&stripmeta=true&url=https:\/\/untappd.s3.amazonaws.com\/photos\/2025_09_26\/7c608e8d702a8312df29221602d3f543_c_1516258776_raw.jpg","photo_img_og":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/photos\/2025_09_26\/7c608e8d702a8312df29221602d3f543_c_1516258776_raw.jpg"}}]},"source":{"app_name":"Untappd for iPhone - (V4)","app_website":"http:\/\/untpd.it\/iphoneapp"},"badges":{"retro_status":false,"count":1,"items":[{"badge_id":5392,"user_badge_id":1335436487,"badge_name":"2X (Level 12)","badge_description":"When a single isn’t enough, make it a double.

In Perpetuity is brewed with a simple malt bill and two of my favorite hops - Citra, and Nelson.  It pours a hazy bright orange in the glass and mixes notes of tropical fruit with a strong citrus backbone.  Soft, and eminently drinkable.  I hope you enjoy it.","is_in_production":1,"created_at":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 01:08:00 +0000","user_rating_score":0,"rating_score":4.382,"rating_count":33908,"has_had":null,"on_list":false,"auth_rating":0,"wish_list":false},"brewery":{"brewery_id":20084,"brewery_name":"Tree House Brewing Company","brewery_slug":"tree-house-brewing-company","brewery_page_url":"\/treehousebrewco","brewery_type":"Regional Brewery","brewery_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/brewery_logos\/brewery-treehousebrewingcompany_20084.jpeg","country_name":"United States","contact":{"twitter":"TreeHouseBrewCo","facebook":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/treehousebrewco","instagram":"TreeHouseBrewCo","url":"http:\/\/www.treehousebrew.com"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Charlton","brewery_state":"MA","lat":42.1400986,"lng":-72.0152969},"brewery_active":1},"friends":{"items":[],"count":0}},{"total_user_count":0,"has_had":null,"total_count":54831,"beer":{"bid":1866209,"beer_name":"Super Sap","beer_label":"https:\/\/assets.untappd.com\/site\/beer_logos\/beer-1866209_006c6_sm.jpeg","beer_style":"IPA - Imperial \/ Double","beer_abv":7.9,"beer_ibu":0,"beer_slug":"tree-house-brewing-company-super-sap","beer_description":"Super Sap pours a hazy yellow color in the glass and emits aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, papaya, Hawaiian punch, and a soft pine-like bitterness.\r\n\r\nSuper Sap is an imperial interpretation of Sap brewed with the spirit of the holiday season in mind!

Over the years we have resisted the urge to brew GGGreennn as we have worked very hard to make Green the very best beer it can be with a carefully refined base beer and very large kettle and dry hop additions. It's easy to overdo it, but over time we have learned how to adjust our process brewing the base beer to successfully accommodate larger and larger hop additions without imparting off putting characteristics. \r\n\r\nFor GGGreennn we pushed those principles to the extreme. The result is a richly hop saturated beer featuring notes of pineapple, guava, dried jackfruit, tropical fruit and citrus. It carries a richness about it that is unique to classic Green, and yet never challenges or tires the palate. It is a pleasure to drink all the way through the glass.
