A slugifier that converts utf-8 latin characters to their ascii counterpart.
All non-recognized characters are removed, only lowercase alfanumerical characters
and dashes are left. Also has an option to strip away starting, ending and double dashes.

Conversion is based on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_characters_in_Unicode

  gem install slugify
