really needs a lord of the rings reference on the label
would take some getting used to
the bitterness takes some time to get used to
a nice pale ale with a hint of volcano
a good morning beer. with bacon and eggs. also beer #300!
easy drinking, great in hot weather
a good choice
take the regular low quality chang and add way too much malt

fairly standard lager
china standard
solid can, solid beer
a strange taste, takes a bit to get used to
a mild ginger taste. the warming sensation makes me think this isn't meant for summer

really hard to drink
the purple label made me expect poison. but its actually a decent beer

tastes pretty much as you would expect from the name
one of those brewing companies that thinks traditional means better

this company seems incapable of making a good beer
probably the best of a bad bunch
so much better than expected considering its an extra

a nice balance of chilli and beer. and yes that is a whole chilli in the bottle
strong chocolate taste but takes a while to get used to
a bit harsh for what i would call a golden ale
one of the strangest beers i’ve tasted. like trying to cross a lambic with a stout

an average ale
like a red guinness gone wrong
a bit of a hobo taste, but not terrible
i'm amazed that this doesnt taste like an absolute mess
pretty nice
tastes like christmas
not too bitter with a mild hoppy taste

an ok trappist
well rounded
like a lager that warms you up

a bit too harsh
a mild belgian beer. +1 for the sweet glass
not as good as when you buy it in belgium

doesnt have the flavour of their other brews
strong ale flavour in a lager
very nice
pretty good

reminds me of some belgian beers but not nearly as good
just like other easy drinking beers from the region
good all round
a fairly standard beer
a lager with a bit of a tang
not my kind of beer
a nice pale ale
could go for a case is this
what you want on a summer afternoon
a little bit harsh for me
wasn't expecting much
its ok
such a letdown after the pale ale
a very nice malty flavour
not that pumkiny
a true weisbeer. i don't like it
cheap and malty
a very refreshing lager
an all round good beer
very gingery but a little bit too fizzy
kind of a pale crossed with an ipa
mild on flavour and smell. a really easy drinking beer

malty
like a really mild pale ale
a fairly plain ipa. a good choice if you’ve never had one before
not really sure what this beer is supposed to be. but it’s for olympians
a tasty bev
nicely hoppy
pretty average
not really worth getting again
not one to rush, not too smokey either
standard easy drinking lager
was hoping for so much more than with this giant beer
probably just a rebrand of some other generic beer
not giving me what expected
not my favourite golden ale. only slightly better than regular crown
a little bit harsh. wouldn't buy again
doesnt really taste like a pils
a fairly tasteless session beer
just a bad tasting beer
a little bit too bitter
rich but not right
a great beer for a nice day
so so bland
just a standard cheap german lager. but such an awesome can
not as bad as i expected from the price
a nice balanced ipa
one of the nicer wheat bears  tasted
a little bit nutty
rum flavour in beer is no good for anybody
tastes way too metallic
too much of a white beer flavour for me
not at all a pale ale. matilda bay lets me down once again
could do with a bit more punch
not really much of an experience
lots of flavour, couldn’t have many
way too much of a smokey flavour
not sure why these are always reduced to clear at dan murpheys
not much flavour or alcohol content
a pale with a bit of a strong ale flavour
not my favourite pale ale
a slight hint of chocolate
i do like an easy drinking golden ale
goes well with a nice italian meal
just not really hitting the spot tonight
an ok pilsner
coopers seem to have a huge range of random beers, sadly the quality varies quite a bit
could literally drink this all day. another from the great selection at parsons
so much flavour, so much booze. what’s not to love
very bland
ok for a wheat beer
never heard of this, was hoping for something better
not as good or as strong as the quadrupel
a fairly mild stout
slightly above average italian beer
i need to sample some more doppelbocks
there are just so many bad english beers
not a very nice stout
enjoyed this more than i expected
just an awful flavour combination
this beer has never been good, but at least it has always been cheap
such a lovely beer all round. makes me want to go back to belgium
a very mild ipa. easy drinking but not what i want from an ipa
i don't remember ever seeing another type of beer in greece
plain and boring
a little bit metallic. not sure why this was recommended to me
strong on alcohol, mild on flavour. perfect for getting drunk quickly
not really my kind of beer
very easy drinking. very close to water
a nice floral aroma but a little bit harsh
like a crappy lager but black
mild but well rounded
surprisingly this is a ginger beer. and while i do like ginger beers this isn’t one of the better ones
fairly mild for a wheat beer
seems like its a cheap flavourless wheat beer but since i don't like wheat beer i'm ok with that
tastes the same as the green one but not as strong
tastes like water
slightly too sweet but ok
not exciting
a nice tasty ipa. i like the lack of a bitter aftertaste
very tasty, but the fizz is a bit strange. sits in such a strange middle ground but i want more
a nice hint of honey. sweeter than most beers
your regular plain cheap lager
a nicely rounded flavour
quite a smooth lager. or could just be that it’s the first beer on friday
pretty plain, time to move onto something stronger today
was expecting this to taste like milk but it’s just a creamy stout
too sweet for me, just doesn’t take like a beer anymore
not sure why this gets branded as a hipster beer. it’s just a bland lager
has a really strong hit of chilli but i like that. you get the coolness of a beer mixed with the heat of chilli
a well balanced pale ale
a little bit too fizzy but nice otherwise
a classic. need to find this on tap somewhere
makes me want to try more kolsch beer
i’m a fan
too malty. one of the worse polish beers i’ve had
a bit plain for me but very good for what it is
standard lager
lager with something extra but nothing special
little creatures is like a baseline for a type of drink
average aldi lager
surprisingly this tastes better after i brushed my teeth
a little bit metallic. not my favourite
a nice chocolate flavour
very bitter but without any sort of floral hop taste to balance it out
lots of subtle character
really subtle watermelon taste. takes a while to get used to
a little stronger than a lager
basic wheat beer
nicely hopped
a very nice chocolate flavour
more harsh than crisp. a little bit more bitter than it should be
standard lager. like the can though
nice sweet hoppy taste
perfect level of bitterness
absolutely amazing
really mild on the choc and raspberry so the beer flavour isn't overwhelmed
like a winery pretending to make a beer
tangy, strong
a beer that goes down easy when you’re in a rush
mild and refreshing
really tasty but also easy to drink
not nearly as good as their other offerings
pretty good all round
standard matilda bay beer
a strange combination. maybe not quite one i could get used to
not a thing right with this drink except that its beer
wouldn’t want another
not what i expected. sweet and strange
not one you see around very often
no fish taste at all
such a cool name and bottle
have to love a nice strong lager
got it from aldi, wasn’t expecting much
pretty average lager
slightly better than your standard
has more of a polish flavour than mexican
one of the best all round beers i’ve tasted
even worse than corona
of the standard australian beers this one ranks pretty low
pretty mild but overall ok. better than expected
one of the nicest white beers i’ve had. another winner from white rabbit
this tastes like a dark ale but isn’t supposed to. the taste is ok but i’m worried by how badly this is labeled
a really mild pale ale but with a great smooth flavour
another winner from steamrail but not as nice as the pale
not as good as the rest of the range
like a very mild pale ale. refreshing
the description on the bottle makes this sound awful but it’s not too bad. could be a little bit smoother but the overall flavour is really nice
a sweet and quite flavourful lager
young henry’s haven’t let me down yet
surprisingly happy with this one
perhaps a few too many hops for me
standard cheap beer
mmm, pale ale
not the best triple but a nice flavour none the less
a hearty beverage
not up to the normal lord nelson standard
too much like a lager
mild sweet brown ale. surprisingly easy drinking
was hoping for a hoppier taste. more of a pale ale for getting smashed
like a tangy lager
was expecting more from this. it’s the nice pale flavour but with too much harshness
good towards the end
nice and easy drinking, but still a mid strength
not what i usually expect from a dark ale
very nicely done. great for a session beer
a very flavourful lager
a solid flavour
tastes more polish than czech
has a slight tang to it that you don’t get with australian bitters
was expecting much more. just a plain lager
a bit too much like a standard lager
the best wheat beer  ever tasted
the logo looks dodgy but its actually a nice mild pale ale
as i expected a plain flavourless lager
surprisingly good and well rounded
a little more flavourful than normal german beer
a little better than a standard lager
a bit too malty
floral and tangy. much better than expected
an all round terrible beer
much hoppier than a normal pale
not much of an ipa but a nice belgian tripel
no idea how this can be called a pale ale
nothing premium about this
a slightly bitter but well rounded pale ale
a mild ipa that really hits the spot. nice floral aroma
a little bit too sharp for me
ok, but something is just wrong
like the wet hop, need to find more
like mixing black current juice with a beer
bitter like an ipa but without the floral hoppiness
amazing how similar this is to a normal lager
cross between a pale and an ipa
a bit harsh for me
a lot of flavour in this beer but it’s not quite right
a crappier version of the regular superdry
a very well balanced and floral ipa
a bit of a let down. doesn’t have what i expect from a pale ale
really mild for a pale ale but also really mild on alcohol as well. guess it would be good if you’re just getting into beer
another good beer from matso’s but still a mid strength
zesty as promised. really high quality all round
pretty run of the mill english ale
a really nice sweet hit of flavour
one of the nicer esbs that i’ve had. but perhaps i just don’t know what an esb is supposed to taste like
this beer is just all wrong. tastes more like an ipa than a pale and the fizz is just strange
nothing premium about this
a kind of sweet mexican lager
i really wanted to like this beer because of the cool bottle but the flavour just isn’t right
missing the boxes its trying to tick
nicer than the pale
a fairly mild belgian beer
nothing special but nothing wrong with it
has a strange aftertaste that completely ruins the beer
a pretty average ipa which slightly misses the mark
not a favourite but a well rounded flavour
water with a hint of beer. good for a summer day
i think the creators were lazy
not that different from a new
decent but there’s just a little something wrong
mild but with an underlying taste that’s really nice
very hoppy with a nice finish
a fairly mild stout
lacking the rounded finish that i was hoping for, but not too bad
has a little bit of paleness to it
super strong, comes in a giant can and tastes better than normal lager. an all round winner
strong and bitter, could do to be a bit more floral
the same as all the other thai beers
has the flavour of a german beer but the quality is slightly lacking
not sure how this qualifies as a beer but its pretty nice regardless
a little bit more tangy than other thai beers
doesn’t really taste like a dark lager, just a really crisp and clean lager
a slightly stronger and nicer version of the regular cheers
filipino version of san miguel. not nearly as nice as the spanish version
a microbrew copy of every other tasteless mid strength lager out there
so hard to find the full strength xxxx even in qld. and its easy to see why. needs a shot of vodka like in the old days
a cherry beer. a little bit too see to drink much but nice in small doses
standard lager
really good example of an ipa
gotta love citra hops
very crisp for a wheat beer
a bit of a let down, just too bitter
a good session beer
well known but not the best example of a belgian dubbel
my biggest disappointment so far from two birds
very good ipa but not sure if its a good session beer
a little bit of a let down from the ipas
a regular beer pretending to be something more
pretty good all round
slightly bad czech lager. but at least it’s gluten free
standard
a bit too bitter
a very well rounded pale ale but not that much flavour
a very mild flavoured wheat beer
a fairly unsweet brown
really mild and nice chilli flavour but there's a little too much bitterness
i great ipa for people who are new to beers with flavour. mild but really well done
never quite tasted right but perhaps i was having an off day
a fairly plain lager
really mild apple flavour, like a cider without all the sugar
fizzed for about 10 minutes and then just tasted a little blemished
a little on the weak side but a really good pale flavour
really nice colour but the flavour misses the mark
a fairly nice porter, but nothing great
has a kind of silty texture to it and an eastern european tang
really nice floral flavour. gotta love citra hops
just can't get into this. its heavy without a nice flavour behind it
has some sort of wrong tinge to it and nothing to redeem that
mild but very tasty. one of the first from batch that i really like
actually more creamy than a normal beer. really nice
really well balanced but a little lacking in flavour
a bit of a harsh flavour. disappointing after the kolsch
a little harsh all round without any real nice flavour to back it up. you get used to it but why bother
really nice secondary flavour. could drink a lot of these
a solid ipa, better than i expected
i haven’t had many rye ipas but so far they’ve all been great beers
better than i expected, but then i was pretty worried about this one
another winner from mornington. really strong on flavour but without any harshness
saw this a lot in melbourne and wish it would start showing up in sydney. glad to see some more brewers making kölschs
nothing much to say about this one
all round decent pale ale
a strange looking beer but has a lovely mild belgian taste
another pale ale that falls short. seems like too many australian pales are targeting the lager audience
an ok beer but there was a slight tang that i didn’t like. i feel like this brewery has so much more to offer
fairly inoffensive lager. can’t complain
it’s beer
slightly syrupy. gives that nice warmth that makes sense at christmas. just not in australia. still great flavour all round
there’s a fair bit of flavour but it’s just harsh. not my cup of tea
i may be unique in that i find that chilli and beer are a perfect combination; and this is the best one i’ve had so far
a little bit harsh for a session beer
a little too much bitterness without the flavour to back it up
pretty standard
the apricot is very faint but kind of interferes with the other flavours in an unpleasant way
super bitter without a bold ipa flavour. sadly the awesome name doesnt translate into flavour
eastern european maltyness. ok for a cheap beer
really nice hop profile for a flavoursome ipa
really strong on the hops, just a little too bitter
very sour and bitter. not for me
like a normal ipa distilled into a super potent form. too much for me right now but i should retry
a textbook ipa. bitter with a strong hop flavour. i just picked it because of the bears having sex on the label
low on bitterness, high on aroma. can't decide between this and the citra
such an amazing sour lambic. the nerd reference is just a bonus
listed as an amber but kind of like an ipa but a little smoother
like a guinness with a little more coffee flavour
perhaps one of the mildest beers  ever had but has a great balance between sour and salty. deducting points because its a mid strength
a rather sweet taste compared to the regular asahi
a lot more plain than i expected. there's a really slight oat aftertaste but i was hoping for it to dominate the beer
perhaps not the best beer at 10am. the belgian flavour seemed a bit too wheaty
pretty plain lager, easy drinking. +1 because of the giant can
amazingly floral but with so little bitterness. has a slight spicyness as well which balances perfectly
a little tangy for a pale but still nice. though on further tasting  found some bottles to be a little bit too tangy and tastes more like an imperfection than a feature
surprisingly flavourful for a summer beer. nice little tang to it
easy drinking lager. good for an all day drink
fairly plain and easy drinking
kind of tart but sits in a strange place like it can't decide what to be
the description sounded good but didn't quite hit that mark
well named, you can't quite pick what you're drinking. not bad but fails to master any category
i expected more, there's a slight metallic taste which shouldn't be in a nice beer
too harsh on the tongue. the one time  wanted a smaller bottle
too harsh, this brewery is still yet to win me over
started off a bit harsh but was a lot better than other black ales. makes me want to try more dark beers
surprisingly tangy with very little bitterness. worth a try
refreshing but not my favourite flavour
i’m always disappointed by english ipas since the flavour i want from an ipa is more akin to the american interpretation with much more floral hops
nicer than expected. has a slightly spicy finish
not tasty enough to justify the low alcohol
crisp and refreshing but nothing special
an interestingly strong flavour but it maintains a smooth finish
i love a good kolsch. so easy drinking but without being flavourless
the final sip of this beer made me sad that it was gone
the mango flavour doesnt overpower what is already a fantastic ipa
pretty much a lager. much less exciting than i thought
perhaps the saltiest beer  ever tasted. but once the initial salt is gone there's a really pleasant flavour without the normal beer bitterness
started off with a bit of a tang but seemed to lose it towards the end
nicely rounded. another winner from mornington
really refreshing with the right amount of hop flavour for a pale ale
disappointingly plain
still yet to have a bad beer from mountain goat though they are a bit too similar
an ipa with a sweet finish
scottish ale isn’t one of my favourite styles so i can’t give it a top rating
has a really mild ginger taste. the smell is a little strange but the flavour really grows on you
surprisingly this cheap beer is one of the better wheat beers that i’ve had. the tang is really well balanced. that said it is a bit light on flavour
a lot lighter on flavour than i expected but then the bottle i have is older than it should be. that said it is perfectly balanced down to the last drop and there’s a hint of some deliciousness there. not worth the price you pay in this country but i would love to get a fresh case of this
i can’t enjoy this while eating. the bitterness difference is just too large for my taste buds to cope. outside of that the bitterness is still a little too strong for the hop aroma
so much floral and citrus aroma. more bitterness than i would like but once you get used to it the flavour is amazing
pretty good for a dark beer. fairly smooth and rich but perhaps a little too bitter
no flavour except some bitterness
great smell but a bit lacking on flavour. a nice session ipa
pretty standard wheat beer
doesn’t really taste much like an ipa, nor is it the best belgian blonde
fantastically flavoured pale ale. still mild though
one of the nicer browns i’ve had
hugely fragrant and really tasty
really nice flavour. solid beer all the way
a little sour but not in a bad way
to me the smokiness gives it some harshness that i don’t like
had more flavour than anticipated, it’s actually a lot like the iipa but with less bitterness
don’t have the best memory of drinking this but it was ok
crisp but ultimately flavourless. perhaps  been having too many ipas recently
delicious. a little bitter but lots of hoppy flavour
overly bitter and without much malt flavour. still yet to find a great amber
so thick coming out of bottle. the initial taste is bitter but behind that is a strong and sweet flavour that while not what i normally go for is still really nice
almost no bitterness. its got quite a lot of malt flavour as if it wasn't left long enough to ferment. perfect with a spicy dish
mild on hops but also low on bitterness
it’s bitter and a little malty
a little bit more malty than most german lagers
supposed to be hoppy but it’s just bitter. feels like it’s missing something
smells really good but the taste is a little harsh
it’s not awful but i can’t really get into it
not as fresh as i was hoping but still nice
has a strange smell and a kind of malty taste
the bitterness is a tad too harsh but it’s nicely hopped
standard malty european cheap lager
a bit too much yeastyness which overrides the other flavours, this has reduced considerably as the beer has aged. otherwise rather mild on flavour without much hop punch
has a bit of a yeasty smell but it’s covered up a bit by a mild hop aroma. low on bitterness with a bit of sweetness and not too malty. all round quite drinkable
nicer than i expected, quite a bit of hop aroma coming off this and a well rounded taste
really nice ipa, little strong but a good hop profile
lacks on every side. no hops and way too bitter
really nice. not too strong on flavour but well balanced. give it a go if you're new to pale ales
can't pick what the flavour is but i like it. not as plain as i was expecting
very little hop flavour, mostly just bitterness. somewhere underneath there’s a nice flavour trying to break through
could be a little hoppier but its still smooth and sweet with a nice hint of caramel
kind of tastes how it looks. like a like cordial mixed with beer. the little bit of spice ties it together and makes for a nice sweet beer
a little more bitter than i was hoping but has a nice hop finish
really citrusy, a little too bitter but still a great drink
fizzy and dark and sweet
the belgian flavour makes it taste stronger than it is. it’s fairly good but there are so many better belgian beers out there that it’s not doing enough to bring me back
interesting smell but the taste is covered up too much by the bitterness
pretty good all round. has a nice sweetness which balances well against the slight citrus hop profile
tastes like a cheap eastern european beer
doesn’t have the same floral taste that their other beers have. it’s still hoppy but more of the bitterness is coming through
creamy, rich and oh so dark. the coffee flavour is mild enough for me to enjoy
huge floral hop aroma. perhaps just a tad too bitter but very enjoyable
another great beer from pirate life. nicely hoppy
had a slightly metallic taste to start but otherwise it’s a really clean and crisp beer. much milder in taste than other belgian beers. i’m beginning to get the feeling that belgian ipas don’t have the hop profile that i expect
great kölsch. crisp and clean but keeps you coming back
pretty plain ale
a very sweet lager with much more flavour than your average lager
has a yeasty and hoppy smell like my other beers but with a mild stout smell. the stout taste is milder than when i bottled it. to me it’s a great because it doesn’t have the kick like other stouts but this may disappoint those who look for that in a stout
quite mild on the stout flavour, sweet and tasty
pretty good pale ale. nothing super exciting
my first cucumber beer. tastes a lot like pickles. its interesting but it wouldn't bring me back
pretty much a red ipa. nice flavour but doesnt have as much floral aroma as i like
nicely floral, not too bitter. all round good ipa
strong on flavour, big on hops
smells like and ipa, tastes like a stout. but still pretty good
not as hoppy as the label indicates,  almost european in the maltyness
one of the less sweet porters i’ve had but still not bitter. not my favourite
tastes like a belgian ale. it’s alright
like other belgian ipas it’s not very hoppy
pretty good pilsner
smells hoppy but tastes stouty
pretty spot on for what i expect from an amber ale but doesnt have a flavour i love
only slightly sour and it all comes together well. its not a style that i'm used to but i do enjoy it
the slight watermelon taste makes it hard to enjoy the beer. you get used to it but there's not a lot of reason to
mild and sweet. nice easy drinking porter
a little bit too stouty and bitter for me but otherwise good
a little bit lacking on the hop side but well rounded. kind of want to know what hop and malt they use
pretty plain lager, slightly better than your standard australian beers
very bitter and lacking in hops but ok
has a few flavours which are hard to pin down but it works well. has a nice amount of sweetness
nothing particularly good about this beer. it’s drinkable but that’s about it
malty european pils. nothing special
smells strange bad but tastes completely different. having trouble describing exactly what i’m getting here, kind of like watermelon. perhaps too many things going on all at once. i wouldn’t want many but it’s worth the experience
has the floral smell that i love in an ipa and a nice balance of bitterness and hops. a great example of an ipa
not nearly as sweet as i expected, almost had a sour note. once i got used to it it was an enjoyable drink
one amazing beer. spot on with bitterness and fruitiness
a little bit too bitter and too stouty for me. not getting any chocolate either
fruity like a soft drink but still bitter like a beer. smells a little bit like past. different and refreshing
an interesting beer. could do with a little more hop flavour to go with the sourness but refreshing as it is
like a really sweet ipa. there’s something else in there that i can’t put my finger on
a little underwhelmed with the hop flavour, it didn’t come out as strong as i expected. while i wouldn’t really call this an ipa it’s still a nice beer. not too bitter and really easy to drink
fairly mild on flavour. easy to drink and refreshing
more of a belgian flavour than i expected. ok but not great
has a slightly sweet taste and a spicy finish. drink it quick before it gets warm
there's an interesting background flavour, perhaps honey, but its overwhelmed by the bitterness. a little disappointing
definitely tastes like a belgian ale. not the favourite beer  made but its ok
there’s a slight caramel/toffee flavour that comes through but the apple isn’t there except for the smell. more bitter than my other beers but it’s not overwhelming
a much more in your face stout than my #3. the chocolate hasn’t come through but the sweetness from the lactose has. there’s a noticeable coffee flavour as well that i didn’t expect. amazingly though it comes together really well and is quite easy drinking
too much bitterness overwhelming the other flavours
not as cheap tasting as i expected. low bitterness and a sweet malt profile make it fairly drinkable
almost tasteless. absolutely nothing exciting about this beer
super smokey but not overwhelming. definitely evokes memories of bacon
uninspired south australian lager. not as bitter as other australian brews but there's no hops or malt to make it s decent beer
nicely balanced hops. bitterness is on par for what i expect from a beer like this. great smell too
really refreshing. would go great on a hot day. one of the better wit beers  had
overly bitter with no hop profile
a little bit lacking but not a bad beer
another bitter beer but tastes like a red ale. decent flavours behind the bitterness
very easy drinking. not a lot of flavour but for something you’re drinking all day this would be great. a little bit tangy
definitely an ipa but not terribly nice. surprisingly the bitterness went away as it got warmer and it was a bit nicer
really nice ginger hit
oh so smooth. one of easiest drinking beers i’ve ever had
you can really taste the oak flavours coming through has a slightly strange flavour but overall pretty nice
didn’t think i would enjoy this one as much as the #7 given the hops but it’s just as good
easy drinking. fairly dry and not too bitter
really tasty brew. not as bitter as i expected which works well with mild hop flavour
my first from this brewery, happy so far. mild on hops but the sweetness from the malt holds it together
a little bit too yeasty. not what i expect from a summer ale
perfect example of a belgian
the best saison  had. like drinking a piece of fruit
so much hop aroma with no bitterness. a style  been searching for but it could be more balanced
there's a beautiful flavour but its hidden behind some harshness which slightly spoils it
smooth but without the backing to make it a great beer
really mild easy drinking stout. kind of lacks any interesting depth of flavour
takes a bit of getting used to, orange doesn’t usually go with salty. not something i would buy again
crisp and dry. very easy drinking, a great pale ale for someone new to beer
the hops cut through what i normally dislike in a wheat beer. nicely aromatic and not too bitter
a nice balance between beer and coffee. could do with some more sweetness
really citrusy which hides the yeastiness
tastes like it wants to kill me. was this even supposed to be consumed?
super strange color but with an amazing taste. starts with a kick then followed by a mild berry sweetness which then mellows out for a smooth finish
super flavourful. initially it’s very bitter but once you get over that it’s amazing. it’s exactly what i expect when a beer says it’s an ipa. not to mention it just looks beautiful in a glass. if you see it try it out
after the ipa i just had this seems a bit tasteless. it’s not bad in any way it’s just that i had already been spoiled somewhat during the evening. the name is of course what drew me in and can’t be faulted but the beer isn’t as flavourful as i would like
after having 2 ipas this was the perfect follow on. my palate was fully ready to ignore the 113 ibus and delve into the flavours beneath. it’s full of citrusy hops which give you fruitiness but with the undeniable awareness that this is a strong beer. as i finish my glass i look at the bottom with sadness that i have no more of this supreme liquid, i’m left only with the hoppy smell of the bottle and the realisation that the next beer will not be as good
not terribly exciting. the agave seems to smooth it out a bit but not enough to really differentiate it
has a nice balance between ipa bitterness and the easy drinking of a pale. its not special but its a crowd pleaser
strong on galaxy hops, low on bitterness. really easy drinking but in no way plain
no question of the vanilla. the sweetness makes it a really nice porter but by the end of a pint it felt like a bit much. would only recommend ordering a middy
has a really strange flavour in the back. interesting as something  not had before but not going to bring me back
an interesting style. kind of a half sour beer.  hints of cherry. worth a look if you want something new
more of a stout than a brown due to the lack of sweetness. kind of disappointing
nice hoppiness but theres a harshness to it that detracts a little bit
the smokiness enhances the bitterness without adding much
nice level of yeast flavour vs sweetness. makes me not hate saisons
ok, but a little mild. for some reason i thought it was an ipa not a lager
a little lacking in flavour but easily drinkable
not really my cup of tea. the flavours just don’t seem to work well together
quite a dry beer. nothing exciting or worth looking for
reminds me of drinking in shoreditch. initially lots of coffee and chocolate but then a slight milkiness. easy drinking and also lots of flavour
given the 80 ibu it’s amazing how smooth and easy drinking this beer is. great to see a west coast ipa which strives for balance over just packing in hops
i love the smell and the floral side of the hops but there’s a harsh bitterness that’s out of place. it’s a decent ipa but there’s nothing amazing going on
definitely a lot of hops but the heavy use of earthy hops leaves it bitter but without any exciting flavours. my first from this brewery so hopefully the rest of their range is a bit better
smells citrusy and yeasty, the yeasty smell probably being the biggest let down. has a sweet and very mild taste. a very refreshing and easy drinking beer. also it just look beautiful
amazingly crisp smell of passionfruit coming through. doesn’t carry through as much in the taste but it’s still there. there’s a bitterness too but it’s nicely balanced and overall delicious. this beer delivers everything it says on the can
a little over carbonated with no head retention but still a tasty drop. fairly easy drinking with just a mild hop flavour. has a sweet finish that takes away the bitterness
has a lovely nice yeasty aroma. there’s a rich warming sensation as you drink combined with a rich full flavour that is exactly what i expect from a tripel. absolutely no harshness despite the high percentage and barely any perceptible bitterness
lots of flavour given that it’s a session ipa. seemed a little too bitter at first but once you get used to that it’s easy drinking. more earthy than floral but well balanced
one of the better smoked beers that  had due. from the first sip one of the strangest beers  had but it definitely got better. by the end the smokiness was less evident and i could enjoy the multitude of other flavours
the flavours aren't quite coming together on this one. the smell works but there's just too much bitterness from the grapefruit
like taking a regular lager and boosting it in every way. stronger, more flavour and less harshness. good for enjoying at a moderate pace
one of the better beers from nomad. just a slight saltiness but mostly just a refreshing beer
better than expected. has that malty eastern european taste but there’s a little bit of a tang which rounds it off nicely
just the beer  been looking for. barely any bitterness but full of hop flavours. smell is all pine and floral. not getting the juiciness promised but decent as an ipa
really rounded flavour. much less hoppy than my other brews and the slight apple tang adds something that you wouldn’t normally see. the high abv adds another element. overall a decent and unique beer
very refreshing. has a slight creaminess
refreshing and easy drinking. low bitterness, not much in the way of hops but enough to make it tasty
its what it says it is so i can't complain but there's a mildness that leaves me wanting.  neither a great hop profile nor a punch in the face. perhaps if i got a pint it would have been better
you can really taste the gingerbread. there's also a lot of stoutiness. can't say i would buy another but its very interesting
nicely aromatic. easy drinking. the mildest beer  had from the pirate life range
has a bitterness that never really resolves into a great flavour
not too bad. the bitterness sits well with the slight stoutiness
really floral hop profile. not nearly as big as i expected from the description but its a nice balance that i could drink a few of
kind of a mix between an ipa and a pale. low on bitterness but high on hops. great as a session beer
fairly plain lager. i don't want another
a good beer to enjoy slowly. unmistakably a porter but it all fits together well
its been a while since  had a beer that takes so long to get used to but continues to get better. still can't say i love it but i would love to have more to continue to tease out the flavours
pretty good tipple this triple is. easy drinking, nice and rounded. slight spiciness. all the things i love
decent aroma but lacks flavour. doesnt qualify as a double ipa but still decent. too many cheap hops i think
not the greatest pale. just not the hops for me. but its not offensive
has the pumpkin spice taste but the aftertaste has something confusing that slightly ruins it
low bitterness and the oats add a lot of smoothness. worth trying even if you're not a fan of stouts. as it goes down the creaminess becomes more evident
