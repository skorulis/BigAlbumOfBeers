For a while now I've been picking up random beers just to see how they taste. Today I have decided to take it one step further and create [The Big Album Of Beers](https://www.facebook.com/skorulis/media_set?set=a.10151283325498745.519514.578408744&type=3). Now every time that I have a new beer I'm going to take a photo, add it to the album and give it a rating. 

The ratings themselves are completely subjective and are just an indication of whether I enjoyed the beer. I'm in no way qualified to be a beer judge so it's simply my enjoyment at the time. This of course could be influenced by many factors. So don't complain if you feel a beer rating is incorrect, because it probably is.

Today I'm starting with the first beer for the album, [Black Sheep Ale](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151283325868745&set=a.10151283325498745.519514.578408744&type=3&theater). And it's pretty terrible, definitely not wanting to go back for another.
