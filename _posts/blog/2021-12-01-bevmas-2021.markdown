Bevmas is back again. Shirt was a present when I left UBank.

Day 1<br>
Mountain culture wet bandits 7.4%<br>
Great orange and yellow hazy colouring. Mellow smell of flowers and peaches. Very easy drinking for the strength, just a little tang on the tip of the tongue. **9/10**

Day 2<br>
Deeds lazy summer 7.0%<br>
A little bit too much orange which brings some harshness. It’s good to start but gets a bit much towards the end **7.5/10**

Day 3<br>
Mr banks throw pillow 6.1%<br>
Smells a lot like vanilla and tastes a little sweet. Pretty easy to drink but not exciting **7/10**

Day 4<br>
Garage project someone special 8.0%<br>
A hazy IPA that reminds me of old west coast IPAs but with a creamier mouthfeel. Quite high on the bitterness but there’s enough flavour in there that it doesn’t matter. I miss heavy hitting IPAs like these **8.5/10**

Day 5<br>
Jetty road dank and stormy 6.0%<br>
It’s pretty high on the bitterness but any dank hops are overwhelmed by the heavy malts. Towards the end the hops start to subtly come through. Despite the missing hops it’s still a very enjoyable beer **7.5/10**

Day 6<br>
Kaiju tangerine love machine 6.2%<br>
It’s a good level of sourness that doesn’t overwhelm it being a beer. Does remind me of a bitter citrus fruit. Very easy drinking and refreshing **7.5/10**

Day 7<br>
Big shed LUPOwheat 5.0%<br>
Has a nice velvety smooth smell, just a little dank. Quite easy drinking, there’s a bitterness there but it’s not too high. Hard to pick out any individual flavours **7.5/10**

Day 8<br>
Wayward dreaming of an amber Christmas 5.6%<br>
Almost red in colour. Very rich malty flavour that lingers at the back of the tongue. Very little in the smell apart from some malty bitterness. One of the best amber ales I’ve ever had. **9/10**

![December 8th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2021-8.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 9<br>
Hop nation St Nick’s nightcap 4.8%<br>
Reminds me a lot of a standard Aussie lager. The hops haven’t added much flavour, mostly bitterness **6/10**

![December 9th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2021-9.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 10<br>
Ballistic it’s a cracker 7.0%<br>
Gorgeous orange colouring. Full on bitterness with some rich mellow undertones. A very classical west coast IPA. Despite the strong bitterness it still goes well with food. **8/10**

![December 10th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2021-10.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 11<br>
Hawkers solarism 8.0%<br>
Super dark but initial taste is mostly sour. Kind of like a blueberry tart. A pretty slow drink **7/10**

![December 11th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2021-11.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 12<br>
Blackmans simcoe cryo 4.6%<br>
A mild and balanced pale ale. Very easy drinking. Yes I do wash the shirt **7/10**

![December 12th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2021-12.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 13<br>
Nomad gingerbread milk stout 6.0%<br>
Well it’s definitely gingery. Takes a long time to get through that into anything else. Very much like a gingerbread soaked in beer **6/10**

![December 13th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2021-13.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 14<br>
Mismatch XPA 4.8%<br>
An XPA much more on the West coast side than the East. Smell is dominated by caramel. A lot of sweetness and richness in the taste as well. **8/10**

![December 14th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2021-14.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 15<br>
Two birds berry Christmas baby 5.0%<br>
So it looks nothing like a beer, but that’s ok. It’s very fruity with almost no bitterness. Luckily the salt cuts through it making it sickly without being noticeable. Really sits where I like a salted sour. The blueberry is there but not overwhelming. If you’re feeling something on the light and refreshing side, definitely worth a go. **8/10**

Day 16<br>
Foghorn withnail rye 5.6%<br>
A good malty rye with a heavy bitterness. Exactly what I expect from a rye ale. **7.5/10**

![December 16th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2021-16.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 17<br>
Akasha Ron McClane cryo pop IPA 6.0%<br>
Very mellow for an IPA which helps it go down easy. The perfect session IPA but with more booze. **8.5/10**

![December 17th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2021-17.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 18<br>
Kind of hoppy ale with a little belgian ting. Pretty good balance between the two. The yeast comes through much more towards the end **8/10**

Day 19<br>
Slipstream grizzly 6.1%<br>
Interesting mix with the sweetness from a brown and the hops from an IPA. **7/10**

![December 19th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2021-19.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 20<br>
New England wolf & fox Slovenian Hopped Pale Ale 5.2%<br>
Some quite tart hops which gives a little sweetness towards the end **6/10**

![December 20th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2021-20.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 21<br>
Not sure how those 2 things go together at all. It’s light like a pilsner but then has a slightly strange aftertaste like the orange zest in a negroni. Still quite crisp and refreshing **6/10**

![December 21st](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2021-21.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 22<br>
Sunday road Yule Fuel 6.8%<br>
Little bit of hop burn at the end of the can. Has a lot of fruity smells coming off it. Taste is pretty good, rounded at the back of the throat and bitter and malty on the tongue. Gets better and better as I drink **8/10**

![December 22nd](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2021-22.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 23<br>
One drop strawberry vanilla nitro milkshake 5.5%<br>
A lot like strawberries and cream or marshmallows. A good dessert beer, but it does sit on that line of getting too sickly sweet **7/10**

![December 23rd](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2021-23.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 24<br>
Boatrocker triple 9.2%<br>
A pretty perfect belgian triple. It’s like I expect the alcohol to come through but it never does **10/10**

![December 24th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2021-24.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 25<br>
Sauce stoutmas 9.0%<br>
It’s a bit too much coffee for me. Dark and thick and goes down surprisingly easy. **7.5/10**
