Day 1<br>
Spotty dog double west coast IPA 9.6%<br>
Starting off strong. A whole lot of bitterness that you expect from a strong west coast IPA. Smells piney and a little dank. Taste hits the spot without being very exciting. **8/10**

Day 2<br>
Mountain culture esky in the boot 8.0%<br>
A bit of burnt hops to start but that faded quickly. Has a mild fruity smell with a bit of orange. The alcohol comes through a little in the taste which is otherwise bitter and fruity. Feels like there's something missing **7.5/10**

Day 3<br>
New England Dapper 5.5%<br>
It delivers what I expect from a special bitter. But the bitterness is combined with an ashy taste in the way you get from an English hand pump ale. Smells much the same as it tastes with a biscuity aroma. I got used to it as I was drinking but it's not the style for me. **4.5/10**

Day 4<br>
Yullis smoked mango chilli sour 4.7%<br>
Smoke > chilli > sour > mango. It's a lot to put in a light beer and it doesn't balance out that well. I like all these things separately but they don't work together. **4/10**

![December 4th](/img/blog/bevmas2023/4.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 5<br>
Blackmans citra cryo 4.6%<br>
A fair amount of dank for a pale ale. Reminds me of a classic IPA but a little milder. Smells piney and fresh. It’snothing new but would be great to have a few of these. **8/10**

![December 5th](/img/blog/bevmas2023/5.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 6<br>
Deeds Eight maids a milking 6.5%<br>
My kind of beer, a nice creamy IPA. Smells citrusy and floral and tastes oh so smooth. A little bit of burnt hops in the bottom of the can. **8/10**

![December 6th](/img/blog/bevmas2023/6.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 7<br>
Hop Nation Czech Pilsner 4.5%<br>
Pretty standard pilsner which sits on the lighter side. Low on malt making for a crisp finish. **7/10**

![December 7th](/img/blog/bevmas2023/7.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 8<br>
Banks Smoochin with everybody 6.9%<br>
Very fruity in the smell. Tastes a lot like it looks. Strong in flavour but still has delicate notes and very little harshness. The more I drink the more I want. **9/10**

![December 8th](/img/blog/bevmas2023/8.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 9<br>
Kaiju! No Ragrets 11.1%<br>
Surprisingly easy to drink. Smells very sweet and with dark chocolate but it’s more bitter in taste. I expected deeper flavours in something this strong. It gets better towards the end, or maybe I’m just drunk. **6/10**

![December 9th](/img/blog/bevmas2023/9.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 10<br>
Range trapped under ice 6.4%<br>
Doesn't hit those common citrus IPA flavours. Has just a bit of dank hops that sits on the tip of the tongue. Very little harshness or lingering bitterness  **8/10**

![December 10th](/img/blog/bevmas2023/10.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 11<br>
Akasha hop alone 4.2%<br>
Quite a smooth hop profile. Smells earthy. Tastes quite similar to the Akasha XPA but richer in flavour.  **7.5/10**

![December 11th](/img/blog/bevmas2023/11.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 12<br>
Freshwater wave chaser pils 4.5%<br>
Quite a bitter pils. Kind of plain and boring **5.5/10**

![December 12th](/img/blog/bevmas2023/12.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 13<br>
Reckless black IPA 6.0%<br>
Not very hoppy, much more on the sweet malty side. But it is really easy drinking. Leaves a nice bit of sweetness in the mouth. **7.5/10**

![December 13th](/img/blog/bevmas2023/13.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 14<br>
Molly Rose Wit’s the season 4.5%<br>
Not sure I like what they’ve done to this. The pepper flavour covers up the usual banana flavours. Maybe I was just too excited for a standard Wit. **5/10**

![December 14th](/img/blog/bevmas2023/14.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 15<br>
Slow lane Pass the Bock 6.5%<br>
A great dark beer that isn't too heavy. More a very malty rich lager. It's well crafted and on point for the style. **8/10**

![December 15th](/img/blog/bevmas2023/15.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 16<br>
Seven mile quiver killer 7.5%<br>
Perfect classic IPA. Super bitter at first but the malt overcomes it so it doesn’t last. Very easy drinking and I wish I had more. **9/10**

![December 16th](/img/blog/bevmas2023/16.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 17<br>
Little Bang Utopia 5.0%<br>
Poured and initially tasted like the can had gone sour but that faded. There wasn't much flavour left though. It's a decent pale ale but not special.  **6.5/10**

![December 17th](/img/blog/bevmas2023/17.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 18<br>
Green beacon strawberry creaming soda ice cream sour 4.2%<br>
There’s a lot in the name, not sure there is so much in the taste. It does have a slight creaminess but that can’t win past the sour. There’s also very little sweetness. One of the better sours I’ve had and it does taste a bit like strawberries. **8/10**

![December 18th](/img/blog/bevmas2023/18.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 19<br>
Bridge road fog Jnr 3.4%<br>
A lot of juicy aroma for a weak beer. Carries quite nicely through into the taste as well. Kind of like a really nice IPA that has been watered down. Great for a session full of flavour **8/10**

![December 19th](/img/blog/bevmas2023/19.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 20<br>
Good lands steez 5.8%<br>
Has a strange musty taste. Never quite becomes what I would expect from an IPA **6/10**

![December 20th](/img/blog/bevmas2023/20.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 21<br>
Aether lemongrass kölsch 4.5%<br>
Tastes like a cheap lager with a tiny bit of lemon **4/10**

![December 21st](/img/blog/bevmas2023/21.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 22<br>
Boatrocker Belgium calling 5.7%<br>
More bitter than I expected but has the distinctive belgian flavours. Gets better the more I have  **7.5/10**

![December 22nd](/img/blog/bevmas2023/22.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 23<br>
White bay you’ve been naughty 7.0%<br>
A very nice red IPA. A great mix of hops, bitterness and malt. Very enjoyable and I want another. **8.5/10**

![December 23rd](/img/blog/bevmas2023/23.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 24<br>
Hawkers Canadian Christmas Party 10.5%<br>
Sweet and syrupy without being cloying. Tastes a bit like maple syrup. One of the better barley wines that I’ve had that really makes me want more. Also it just looks delicious. **9/10**

![December 24th](/img/blog/bevmas2023/24.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 25<br>
Frenchies giant naked sky Santa has exploded 9.5%<br>
Great name. One of my favourite styles and done very well. Goes down very easy. Like taking a regular beer and ramping everything up **9/10**
