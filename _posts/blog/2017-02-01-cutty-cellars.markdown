I often get asked how I manage to keep finding new beers to drink. Let me start by saying it's not always easy. I've managed to exhaust the big Aussie bottle shops like [Dan Murphey's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Murphy's) so I end up scrounging through smaller independent ones. But for the most part these have a pretty small range. For a long time my goto place was [Liquor Legends](http://www.liquorlegends.com.au/) in Ashfield as they have a surprisingly great range of beers. But it's a bit of a trek to get there so imagine my surprise when the same distributor opened up in my very own suburb.

Now most of you won't be familiar with Bankstown as a suburb but having good craft beer available is definitely not a way most people would describe it. But walking distance from my house I can get access to a great range of beers. The only problem is that it's a quiet shop so they don't manage to rotate through their stock fast enough to keep up with my drinking unique beers. Well not unless I want to start spending $20+ on each beer. But today was a good day, managed to pick up a six pack of some hopefully delicious beers.
