Day 1<br>
Range electric relaxation 6.8%<br>
Juicy and creamy. Huge tropical hop aroma with no harshness. Goes down very easy but a little on the plain side. **8/10**

Day 2<br>
Mountain culture room for pud 9.0%<br>
Very rounded set of hops which lets it go down smoothly. It canâ€™t taste the alcohol but it is enough to warm my chest. I initially got hit with fruity aromas but they seemed to die off quickly. **8.5/10**
