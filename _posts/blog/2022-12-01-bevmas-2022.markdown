Day 1<br>
Range electric relaxation 6.8%<br>
Juicy and creamy. Huge tropical hop aroma with no harshness. Goes down very easy but a little on the plain side. **8/10**

Day 2<br>
Mountain culture room for pud 9.0%<br>
Very rounded set of hops which lets it go down smoothly. It can’t taste the alcohol but it is enough to warm my chest. I initially got hit with fruity aromas but they seemed to die off quickly. **8.5/10**

Day 3<br>
Deeds add to batter slowly 9.0%<br>
Very rich and sweet. Comes off a little bit like a raspberry muffin with those standard stout chocolate notes. Probably better for winter. I don’t think I could have 2 though. **7.5/10**

Day 4<br>
Slow lane whiter shades of ale 5%<br>
I do love a good witbeer and slow lane always deliver. Has a deep belgian ale smell without being strong in taste. The taste is zesty and refreshing **8.5/10**

Day 5<br>
Seven mile cali cartel 4.5%<br>
Says this is a cream ale, I would have guessed a sweet lager. I guess it is a bit thicker on the mouthfeel. Strikes a nice balance between easy drinking and having a little extra flavour. Would go nicely on a beach or with a BBQ **7.5/10**

Day 6<br>
Akasha hop actually 5.5%<br>
Looks great but kind of weak to be called an IPA. It’s a little hoppy but not terribly so. Has a little bit of passionfruit coming through. A nice session beer **7.5/10**

Day 7<br>
Ocean reach peach & pineapple parfait sour 5.1%<br>
Not very sour. The sweet fruits join together a bit like an overripe fruit salad. I tend to like this more as I drink it and I’m enjoying it more than I thought I would. **7.5/10**
