Day 1<br>
Range electric relaxation 6.8%<br>
Juicy and creamy. Huge tropical hop aroma with no harshness. Goes down very easy but a little on the plain side. **8/10**

Day 2<br>
Mountain culture room for pud 9.0%<br>
Very rounded set of hops which lets it go down smoothly. It can’t taste the alcohol but it is enough to warm my chest. I initially got hit with fruity aromas but they seemed to die off quickly. **8.5/10**

Day 3<br>
Deeds add to batter slowly 9.0%<br>
Very rich and sweet. Comes off a little bit like a raspberry muffin with those standard stout chocolate notes. Probably better for winter. I don’t think I could have 2 though. **7.5/10**

Day 4<br>
Slow lane whiter shades of ale 5%<br>
I do love a good witbeer and slow lane always deliver. Has a deep belgian ale smell without being strong in taste. The taste is zesty and refreshing **8.5/10**

Day 5<br>
Seven mile cali cartel 4.5%<br>
Says this is a cream ale, I would have guessed a sweet lager. I guess it is a bit thicker on the mouthfeel. Strikes a nice balance between easy drinking and having a little extra flavour. Would go nicely on a beach or with a BBQ **7.5/10**

Day 6<br>
Akasha hop actually 5.5%<br>
Looks great but kind of weak to be called an IPA. It’s a little hoppy but not terribly so. Has a little bit of passionfruit coming through. A nice session beer **7.5/10**

![December 6th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2022-6.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 7<br>
Ocean reach peach & pineapple parfait sour 5.1%<br>
Not very sour. The sweet fruits join together a bit like an overripe fruit salad. I tend to like this more as I drink it and I’m enjoying it more than I thought I would. **7.5/10**

![December 7th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2022-7.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 8<br>
Ballistic experimental NZ pilsner 6%<br>
Really earthy smell. Rare to see a pilsner with so much abv and it comes through with a bit more flavour. It’s got a good malt but it’s subtle enough to go down easy. **8/10**

![December 8th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2022-8.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 9<br>
Uraidla infernal dimension 6.0%<br>
Has the full red IPA bitterness that you expect. Always I style I like because it’s rare to find. But only 1 or 2 then it becomes too much **7.5/10**

![December 9th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2022-9.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 10<br>
Kaiju mutation program #0011 7.6%<br>
Old school west coast IPA. **8/10**

![December 10th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2022-10.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 11<br>
Jetty road mango session IPA 5%<br>
Sure looks like a glass of mango. Smells fruity too, but the taste just seems to be lacking. **7/10**

![December 11th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2022-11.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 12<br>
Yullis special batch Düsseldorf altbier 4.9%<br>
Lighter than I was expecting. Blends together bitterness and sweetness nicely. Quite easy drinking **7.5/10**

![December 12th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2022-12.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 13<br>
Blackmans single hop cryo 4.6%<br>
Nice fruity pale ale but not overwhelmingly. Really straddles the line between flavour and being good for a session **8/10**

![December 13th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2022-13.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 14<br>
Slipstream walk the plank 7.0%<br>
The oak comes through in the smell which is a bit like rum. Quite subtle despite how it looks. I thought it might be hoppier but I’m happy with how it comes together **8/10**

![December 14th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2022-14.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 15<br>
Two birds equalitea 4%<br>
Very orange in colour which also comes though in the taste. The tea also comes through slightly. I’m a little bit full for how much flavour this has, I would like to try it again **8/10**

![December 15th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2022-15.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 16<br>
Fixation yippee ki-yay 7%<br>
Fairly mellow west coast IPA with a little bit of dank hops. Looks gorgeous and is really easy to drink **8.5/10**

![December 16th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2022-16.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 17<br>
Garage project fool me again 8%<br>
Easy to drink at the start but the bottom has some burnt hops. Still decent **7.5/10**

![December 17th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2022-17.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 18<br>
Sunday road down the rabbit hole 6.8%<br>
Delivers exactly what you would expect. Dark and bitter then a little malty and sweet towards the end. Not that much to bring me back though **7/10**

![December 18th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2022-18.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 19<br>
Nomad Christmas in oktober 5%<br>
Rich, slightly spiced and a little bitter but a lagerish beer at its heart. **7/10**

![December 19th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2022-19.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 20<br>
New England belgo bruin 6.1%<br>
It’s got more yeasty flavour than a usual brown. The sweetness is there but it’s not that strong. Smells a little strange. Overall good **7.5/10**

![December 20th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2022-20.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 21<br>
Hop nation pura vida 5.5%<br>
A very fruity sour but not sweet. Very refreshing and tropical. Would go nicely on a beach. I went through this rather quick **8/10**

![December 21st](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2022-21.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 22<br>
Banks bear county 6.2%<br>
Not sure how this is so dark yet so smooth and easy to drink. Very moorish. **9/10**

![December 22nd](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2022-22.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 23<br>
Pirate life west coast IPA 6.6%<br>
Very high bitterness levels, the hallmark of a west coast IPA. Takes a while to get used to it. Very hoppy smell and flavour **7.5/10**

![December 23rd](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2022-23.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 24<br>
Boatrocker wee heavy 6.5%<br>
Strong on the scotch flavour and tastes like it looks. It’s on point for style but it takes quite a while to warm up to. Not my favourite style **7/10**

![December 24th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2022-24.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 25<br>
Hawkers Bermuda love triangle 13.7%<br>
Smells and tastes a bit like a super boozy Christmas cake. Gets a bit better but the rum is so strong it’s always hard. I think just too much for me **6.5/10**
