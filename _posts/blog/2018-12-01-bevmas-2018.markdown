Day 1
Two birds double taco 7.0%
So different from the regular taco. Very much a classic IPA with a few subtle extras that really add depth and take it to another level. I couldnâ€™t catch the beautiful hazy golden colour in the photo, but it looks as great as it tastes. 8.5/10

Day 2
Quiet deeds pal ale 4.6%
Fairly bitter for a pale but not too much and still easy drinking . Light fruity smell and a dark orange colour. Continues to get better as it goes down 7/10
