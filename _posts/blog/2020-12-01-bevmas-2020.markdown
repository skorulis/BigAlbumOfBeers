After a 1 year break the bevmas calendar is back! A new shirt but the format remains the same. You get 1 photo each day of me enjoying my advent beer.

---

Day 1<br>
Mountain culture Yipee Ki Yay 6.5%<br>
Beautiful thick haze but not nearly as punchy as you would think to look at it. Lots of tropical notes wafting off but it’s a rather mild IPA with hints of pineapple which focuses on getting the flavours right. It would be easy to knock back a lot of these, perhaps I’m just excited to kick off the advent calendar **9.5/10**

Day 2<br>
Seven mile the extra mile 7.7%<br>
Lovely colouring and a very rich west coast IPA, just enough booze to give that warm feeling. No big flavours I can pick, but very rounded **8.5/10**

Day 3<br>
Sunday road the holidays 5.0%<br>
One of the darkest and most full flavoured lagers I’ve had. It’s too strong on the coffee for me and that’s dominating all the other flavours. **5/10**

Day 4<br>
Sauce pineapple squeak 6.2%<br>
Damn they crammed a lot of pineapple in this without it becoming tangy or harsh. Fantastic down to the last drop **9/10**

Day 5<br>
Jetty road mochachino stout 4.8%<br>
A coffee beer I can get much more behind. The coffee is there but the stout flavours come through stronger and balance it out. Very rich and creamy **8.5/10**

![December 5th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2020-5.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 6<br>
Blackmans needs more cascade 6.5%<br>
A heavy dose of hops strong on the citrus. Has a nice little tang at the end that makes you want to come back for another sip.A good old school IPA **8.5/10**

![December 6th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2020-6.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 7<br>
Frenchies soft tropical mist 3.5%<br>
Has a good level of flavour for a mid strength but light enough that you could still easily keep knocking these back. Zesty on the nose with a little citrus tang on the tongue 8/10

![December 7th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2020-7.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 8<br>
Brouhaha hinterland XPA 5.2%<br>
Fairly standard XPA, a little more restrained than the Balter. It’s good, but not exciting **7/10**

![December 8th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2020-8.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 9<br>
Deeds primal horde 7.0%<br>
Creamy and citrusy, a great combination **8.5/10**

![December 9th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2020-9.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 10<br>
Lab ouroboros 6.0%<br>
I was hoping for a bitter red ale but this is a Flemish red ale so actually more of a sour. Not a style I see very often, very refreshing. **7.5/10**

![December 10th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2020-10.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 11<br>
All inn what’s up my grinches 5.5%<br>
Very light on the vanilla but otherwise a good stout. There is a bit of sweetness which probably goes against the name. One of those beers that gets better thee more you drink **8/10**

![December 11th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2020-11.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 12<br>
Ballistic mele kalikimaka 8.0%<br>
Super smooth and pineapplly. Great hazy IPA **9/10**

![December 12th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2020-12.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 13<br>
Hop nation humbug 6.5%<br>
Strong stout flavours and a fair amount of bitterness but somehow smells sweet. It all manages to fit together **7.5/10**

![December 13th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2020-13.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 14<br>
Two birds total eclipse of the hop 5.5%<br>
Quite hoppy to start but then manages to mild out. Pretty on point for an XPA. It’s a good XPA, but there’s better ones around **7/10**

![December 14th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2020-14.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 15<br>
Wayward I’ll be bock 5.5%<br>
It’s a strange mix, dark but not a stout and malty but not to the point of a red and then quite bitter but not as much as an IPA. **7/10**

![December 15th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2020-15.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 16<br>
Nomad Rudolphs little helper 5.5%<br>
It’s trying to be both full of tropical hops and amber malts at the same time, they tend to fight each other a bit to come to the front. Each flavour tends to come to the front on alternate sips . But overall it is a pretty good amber ale, and nice to see something different **7.5/10**

![December 16th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2020-16.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 17<br>
Yulli’s Eugene 4.2%<br>
Decent lager, a nice break after a week of heavy beers **6.5/10**

![December 17th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2020-17.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 18<br>
Revel American brown ale 5.3%<br>
Nice sweet, slightly nutty brown ale. **7.5/10**

![December 18th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2020-18.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 19<br>
Boatrocker life 8.5%<br>
All sorts of strange. Usually barley wines are very sweet but this has a tang to it. Perhaps it was a little cold when I started drinking, as it warmed the sweetness came through more but without getting sickly. One of the nicer barley wines I’ve had. **7.5/10**

![December 19th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2020-19.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 20<br>
Akasha talus 6.2%<br>
Similar to other IPAs from Akasha but with a little something extra that I can’t pick. Whatever it is, it’s delicious **8.5/10**

![December 20th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2020-20.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 21<br>
White bay dreaming 4.8%<br>
Fairly classical belgian wit beer. A little yeasty, but not really that exciting. Lots of better options around **7/10**

![December 21st](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2020-21.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 22<br>
Red right hand red IPA 6.0%<br>
Rich caramel flavours but not much in the way of hops but has a little bitterness. **8/10**

![December 22nd](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2020-22.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 23<br>
Slipstream big billy 6.0%<br>
It’s a pale ale with a little extra kick. The tropical hops come off with a little tangerine tang. All fits together really well **8/10**

![December 23rd](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2020-23.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 24<br>
One drop toasted coconut pineapple nitro milkshake IPA 5.9%<br>
The nitro pour instructions didn’t work too well but it is very smooth. Smells like a Pina colada with lots of coconut coming through and then the pineapple comes through more in the taste. Surprisingly easy to drink given all the things going on in this beer, sadly it’s a once off beer because I could go for some more of these. I really like the way one drop do milkshake IPAs **9/10**

![December 24th](/img/blog/bevmas/bevmas-2020-24.jpg){: .img-responsive }

Day 25<br>
Hawkers knafeh habibi 8.5%<br>
A very cake like stout. I do like how they have mixed pastry and beer. Hard to pick individual flavours but I do like it. **9/10**
