My goal for 2016 was to reach 1000 beers and today I've done just that with a few days to spare. I actually had a specially purchased beer ready for #1000 but I accidentally jumped the gun and got there too early. Luckily it was a decent beer anyway so I don't feel too bad.

Worth mentioning that beer #999 was the absolutely delicious boatrocker tripel scoring a perfect 10/10. If it wasn't for a duplicate beer I had in the album it would have been a brilliant milestone.
