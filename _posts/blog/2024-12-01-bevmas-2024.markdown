Day 1<br>
Wooden axe west coast DIPA 8.5%<br/>
Classic west coast without being too heavy. Smells a bit dank and tastes piney with a bit of caramel. Nothing new about this, but hits the right notes **7.5/10**

Day 2<br>
Boatrocker frontier beer 5.0%<br/>
Bitter and malty while still being crisp. Would make for a good winter lager. Has a slight earthy hop aroma but mostly it’s the malts. **7/10**

Day 3<br>
New England Enkel 5.4%<br/>
Has the clove and banana tastes from a normal belgian but it’s really taking a while to get used to. The smell just seems a bit wrong. The hint of orange carries it through to keep it refreshing. **6/10**

Day 4<br>
Range backwards walk 6.6%<br/>
Lovely creamy hazy IPA. Has a very flowery aroma. Very little bitterness or harshness, the oats really mellow out the taste. Just a little alcoholic kick at the end. Really good mix of hops. **9/10**

![December 4th](/img/blog/bevmas2024/4.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 5<br>
Molly Rose Local Weiss 3.8%<br/>
Smells more like a white wine than a beer. The citrus really comes through in the taste which is a mix of wine and beer and a bit sour. Quite interesting and I would happily try it again. **8/10**

![December 5th](/img/blog/bevmas2024/5.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 6<br>
Fox Friday Play Us A Tune 5.8%<br/>
Like a west coast IPA with a bit of Pilsner which kind of tones down the hops. Very earthy in flavour and well put together **8/10**

![December 6th](/img/blog/bevmas2024/6.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 7<br>
Hop Nation Kringle 5.2%<br/>
Very light for an IPA. Nice hop aroma without much bite in the flavour. **7.5/10**

![December 7th](/img/blog/bevmas2024/7.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 8<br>
Seven Mile 24 Karat Blinged Kölsch 4.6%<br/>
Much fruitier than I expect from a Kölsch, I guess that’s the bling. Ends up like a very light pale ale. **7.5/10**

![December 8th](/img/blog/bevmas2024/8.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 9<br>
Kaiju! Cosmic Cornucopia 6.8%<br/>
There’s a bit of everything going on in this beer. Some heavy roasted malt, some earthy hops and a bit of a west coast IPA flavour. Somehow all fits together to make a unique beer. **8/10**

![December 9th](/img/blog/bevmas2024/9.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 10<br>
Philter Mr Danky The XMAS Brew 5.1%<br/>
Great name and the dank comes through strongly with the grapefruit. Surprisingly easy to drink. **8.5/10**

![December 10th](/img/blog/bevmas2024/10.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 11<br>
Blackmans Aussie Spiced WitBeer 4.3%<br/>
I feel like the spices are detracting from what I like about the witbeer flavours. There’s just something not quite right. **5.5/10**

![December 11th](/img/blog/bevmas2024/11.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 12<br>
White bay Štastné a veselé 5.0%<br/>
Feels like it’s jumped between an amber ale and pilsner as I drank it. Full bodied and malty. **7.5/10**

![December 12th](/img/blog/bevmas2024/12.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 13<br>
Ocean Reach Hop Deity 6.5%<br/>
It’s an ok hazy, but a bit harsh on the hops. **7/10**

![December 13th](/img/blog/bevmas2024/13.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 14<br>
Frenchies Christmas Ale 12.5%<br/>
Sweet with a little bit of prunes coming through. A little strong for my first beer of the afternoon but I got used to it quickly and it got better the more I had. **8/10**

![December 14th](/img/blog/bevmas2024/14.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 15<br>
Banks kind of dreams 6.4%<br/>
Smooth NEIPA with a little bit of stone fruit coming through. Nice pale yellow color. Went down a little with too easy and and I want another **8.5/10**

![December 15th](/img/blog/bevmas2024/15.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 16<br>
Aether Bush Honey Brown Ale<br/>
There’s a hint of honey coming through the bitterness which is really nice. It’s an interesting beer which is a little confusing due to the sweetness and bitterness **7/10**

Freshwater Bright Lager 5.3%<br/>
Kind of plain lager. Ok but nothing to bring me back **6/10**

![December 16th and 17th](/img/blog/bevmas2024/1617.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 18<br>
Yulli’s superdelic hazy pale ale 5.0%<br/>
It’s a great looking hazy pale. There’s a little bit of harshness that takes away from other flavours. **5.5/10**

![December 18th](/img/blog/bevmas2024/18.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 19<br>
Reckless saltbush gose 4.0%<br/>
I think it hits the sour note, but could be a little saltier. **7/10**

![December 19th](/img/blog/bevmas2024/19.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 20<br>
Slow Lane Scot Free 5.0%<br/>
A very bitter ale, would go nicely on a cold night. Quite a biscuity aroma but not much in the taste. Not my favourite style but it’s a nice change. **7/10**

![December 20th](/img/blog/bevmas2024/20.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 21<br>
Mountain culture wizard mode 8.0%<br/>
Right on point and heavy on the bitterness. One of those beers that really grows on you as you drink. **8/10**

![December 21st](/img/blog/bevmas2024/21.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 22<br>
Akasha Ale I Want for Christmas 5.2%<br/>
Smells rich and malty with a biscuity note. Bitter in taste with a fairly neutral flavour and a little bit of caramel towards the end **7.5/10**

![December 22nd](/img/blog/bevmas2024/22.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 23<br>
Bridge Road The Wallet Inspector 5.8%<br/>
Middle of the road AIPA. Quite easy to drink without strong flavours **7.5/10**

![December 23rd](/img/blog/bevmas2024/23.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 24<br>
Good Land Night Before 10.0%<br/>
Perfect name for the occasion. Smells like a boozy Christmas dessert. Tastes like a strong stout with some sweet vanilla. It’s a lot of booze that will have me out before Christmas. **9/10**

![December 24th](/img/blog/bevmas2024/24.jpeg){: .img-responsive }

Day 25<br>
Hawkers Krampus Kringle 8.7%<br/>
Lots of Christmas spices coming through into a rich and malty beverage. Might be a bit better on a cold day. **8/10**
