This year the 26th of January was a tad cold for going to the beach but we would not be deterred as that's part of what Australia day is about. Helping me cope with the weather was a 5L mini keg that my dad had given me for my birthday. It's hard to find a day where you have time to down 5L of beer and this was the perfect time.

Overall it was a decent beer. I suck at using those kegs so I spent about half the day waiting for the head to subside but stretching my drinking out probably wasn't a bad thing.
