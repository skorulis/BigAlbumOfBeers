My drinking has slowed down a little bit since I got home from my holiday so I don't have that many new beers to add. Hoping to get back into it today and get back on track. Perhaps hit up a few new bars that I haven't tried out yet.

<div class="beerlist row">
	{% assign rev = site.data.full %}
	{% for beer in rev %}
		{% if beer.date == "2017-08-06" %}
			{% include beerCell.html beer=beer %}
		{% endif %}
	{% endfor %}
</div>
