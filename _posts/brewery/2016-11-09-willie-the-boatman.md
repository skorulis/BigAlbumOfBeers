review_beer: "It's a fairly small range which hits all the standard favorite styles plus a few more on the adventurous side but overall it's a high quality range of beers."
review_venue: "Situated in what seems like an old warehouse it's got that industrial feel. The corrugated iron walls tend to cause the bar to warm up significantly in the summer which gives a nice excuse to get yourself another beer."
