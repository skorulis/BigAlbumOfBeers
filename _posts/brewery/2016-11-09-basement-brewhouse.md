review_beer: "Most of the brewing process is done offsite with only the final fermentation being done at the actual brewery. Despite this it's a decent range, albeit a little bit safe and boring."
review_venue: "Not what you would expect from a brewery located inside a sports club. Feels much more like an up market hipster spot. With 25 taps there's always something new on offer. If you're looking for a brewery without having to go all the way into the city then it's a good option. "
