score: 8
beer-date: "2024-11-23"
desc: "Has a mix of stone fruit and flowery hops which is very smooth with low bitterness but the mix tastes a little funny. Gets better as I get used to it. Itâ€™s a nice balance to have flavour and be able to have a few. Giving this an extra .5 for being interesting"
