desc: "I can’t pick out any of the dry hop flavours but I’m ok with that because it’s a delicious sour. The kind of sour which gets it right without bothering to worry about hiding it with fruit. It’s hard to say much about this because I don’t have much to compare it to. Definitely worth a try for anyone who feels like experimenting with sours"
