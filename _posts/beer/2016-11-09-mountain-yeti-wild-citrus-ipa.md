category: beer
score: 8.5
beer-date: "2023-08-26"
desc: "Beautiful orange golden colouring and the name fits perfectly with the taste. Citrus and orange comes through with the bitterness from the hops. Has the mellow taste of a west coast IPA. Lots of suspended particles but that doesnâ€™t change the taste"
