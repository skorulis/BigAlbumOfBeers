desc: "It does have that lime and tequila taste that you get with a margarita in the taste but it smells more like a beer. It’s the kind of sour I like where it uses the sourness to pull flavours from other things into a normal light beer. It’s very easy to drink but it’s not the kind of beer that makes me want more"
