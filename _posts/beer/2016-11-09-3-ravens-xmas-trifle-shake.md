category: beer
score: 9
beer-date: "2018-12-27"
desc: "Doesn’t have that perfect haze but that doesn’t spoil the taste. Mild bitterness for an iPA without too many really strong hop flavours. Has a nice hint of custard both in smell and taste. Not something for everyday, but a nice little treat, just like trifle"
