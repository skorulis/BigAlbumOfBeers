score: 7.5
beer-date: "2021-01-14"
desc: "With the lower alcohol percentage the rich flavours you would expect from a triple hop don’t come through, but perhaps that’s the point. The flavours don’t build up and slow down the drinking. Not my style because I’m ok with heavier beers but has nice flavours"
