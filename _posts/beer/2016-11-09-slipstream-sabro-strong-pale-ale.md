score: 6.5
beer-date: "2019-06-22"
desc: "Really strange flavour that I can’t quite place. It tastes strong but there’s not actually that much alcohol. Takes a bit of getting used to. As I finally finish the last warm dregs I work out what the taste is, it’s a tiny hint of super tennents. Despite that, it’s not too bad"
