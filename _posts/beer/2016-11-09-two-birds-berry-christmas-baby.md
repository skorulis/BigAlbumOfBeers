desc: "So it looks nothing like a beer, but that’s ok. It’s very fruity with almost no bitterness. Luckily the salt cuts through it making it sickly without being noticeable. Really sits where I like a salted sour. The blueberry is there but not overwhelming. If you’re feeling something on the light and refreshing side, definitely worth a go"
