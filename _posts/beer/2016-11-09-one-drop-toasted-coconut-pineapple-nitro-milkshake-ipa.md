title: One drop toasted coconut pineapple nitro milkshake IPA
category: beer
score: 9
beer-date: "2020-12-25"
desc: "The nitro pour instructions didn’t work too well but it is very smooth. Smells like a Pina colada with lots of coconut coming through and then the pineapple comes through more in the taste. Surprisingly easy to drink given all the things going on in this beer, sadly it’s a once off beer because I could go for some more of these. I really like the way one drop do milkshake IPAs"
