desc: "Beautiful thick haze but not nearly as punchy as you would think to look at it. Lots of tropical notes wafting off but it’s a rather mild IPA with hints of pineapple which focuses on getting the flavours right. It would be easy to knock back a lot of these, perhaps I’m just excited to kick off the advent calendar"
