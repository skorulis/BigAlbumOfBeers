title: Urbanaut beer blender coconut. Hazy + pineapple sour
category: beer
score: 7.5
beer-date: "2021-01-01"
desc: "Interesting concept, it’s sold as 2 cans joined together designed to be mixed together. The hazy IPA was nice but the sour was a bit too much. Together they mellow each other out, the super sour smell is still there but not as much in the taste. It comes out a little more orangey than I would expect. It’s a fun novelty, but not enough to make me choose it over a standard beer"
