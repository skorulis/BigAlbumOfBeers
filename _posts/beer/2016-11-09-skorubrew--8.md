category: beer
score: 7.5
beer-date: "2016-09-21"
desc: "A much more in your face stout than my #3. The chocolate hasn’t come through but the sweetness from the lactose has. There’s a noticeable coffee flavour as well that I didn’t expect. Amazingly though it comes together really well and is quite easy drinking"
