score: 6.5
beer-date: "2017-03-22"
desc: "A lot of flavour for a small beer. Tastes very much like a west coast IPA. My main complaint is that while the bitterness and hops are there the mouthfeel is a bit watery so it doesn’t have the a nice smoothness. Worth a try but I wouldn’t be looking for another"
