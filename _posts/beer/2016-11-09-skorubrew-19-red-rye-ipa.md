desc: "A little darker than I planned but still red. Has a yeasty, Belgian smell which fades and lets the smokiness through. But the hero here is the taste. The smoked malt and rye add an element that you don’t normally find. The lower bitterness means this flavour doesn’t linger which keeps you wanting more. The Belgian yeast rounds the flavour further and the 7.5% gives a slight warming sensation. My best homebrew yet"
